            "message": "this is a dull , unfunny film , lacking an edge to it , as if the screenwriter is past his prime and maybe should take a year off to re-gain his touch . this sitcom film is actually worst than most sitcoms seen on tv ; it should have come with canned laughter . in the theater i saw it , no one laughed ; and , watching a comedy without hearing any laughs gives me a creepy feeling . the film lacked the kind of comedy expected for a satire . even if the story never took off , i at least expected the film to have some snappy things to say about those who are part of the hollywood establishment and not to mirror it so closely with the hollywood scene that it can't even be considered a parody anymore . i thought brooks mailed this script in . it was hard to think of brooks as a victim of hollywood when he was surrounded by so much wealth and the only thing he strove for was to become even wealthier . he never asked the muse to inspire him to write a great classic , only for some \" summer script \" he can sell to the studios as a blockbuster movie . if he was trying for a parody ( which i assume he was ) , he just didn't succeed . all he succeeded in showing was that there is some bitterness in him and that he's part of the \" fat cats \" who make up the hollywood scene , too complacent to make a real satire with some bite in it . but i think the main problem with the film , besides the fact that it's a one idea film , is how that idea was weak and never developed . the brooks character never spelled out why he was so desperate in the first place and he never showed us how good a writer he was . i feel i must question the film's intent : why should i feel sorry for brooks ? where is the comedy in the film ? what is this nonsense about getting a live muse supposed to mean ? what kind of statement is he making about creativity ? should i really believe that someone would have the chutzpah to make a film about a screenwriter who lost his touch and pays for a muse so he can get that touch back and makes a film that is so flat and uninspired ? is he trying to tell me that people in hollywood will believe in anything and so should i ? and there you have the funniest line in the film and it comes right in the beginning of the film . what goes for comedy in this film , has to do with his whiny relationship to the muse . that dumbness prevails , and he comes up with a lame idea for a film in which he wants to have jim carrey star in , is supposed to be his way of saying that hollywood doesn't know what's good from what's crap , or doesn't care . this is \" i love lucy \" kind of humor . that this film is about making money being tantamount in hollywood to creativity , is a theme that has been often done and this film has not touched on any new ground with that concept . if you make a satire , it better be funny , or if it is a more serious film , it should try to have a script with some characters who are profound and perceptive . to have a satire with nothing to dig into is unfortunate , as brooks chose to go for his laughs by having his character be a whiner , grousing about the demands of his muse , the attention she gives to his wife instead of him , how steven spielberg snubbed him , and how cruel it is to be in hollywood if you are a creative person . this slight aim at comedy turns this film into a slight film . if you really had to see this film , the only reason i could think of doing so , was to see the attractive sharon stone as a muse . even though the script did not provide her with material that was funny , she did show by her facial expressions and body language that she has a penchant for comedy if given a chance . at least she was more lovable than any one else in the film was .",

            "message": "obviously there is no such a place as pleasantville , except in a sitcom . pleasantville is a film about how selective one's memory is when it comes to nostalgia , of pining for values that never existed back then but still are the values exemplified for the traditional family , of the resistance to change , and clashes between those in the film who become \" colored \" and those who remain in \" black-and-white , \" and about the need to be an individual and not conform . it's fairly predictable what will happen once the two realize that they are transformed into an unreal tv world , as the film prepares to go into its satire mold and take apart the blandness of such perfection . the filmmaker then analyzes these changes on those newly affected and the result is a more troubled but more interesting people emerging . through special effects from digital processing , flowers start taking on color and the film begins to have a modern-day \" alice in wonderland \" look to it . j . t . there was something that rubbed me the wrong way about this \" cute \" idea of a film , besides the fact it was boring and i felt as if i was being lectured to about the obvious general ills of society . there are no radical new ideas presented in this film that will make me really think about these issues any differently than the films of the 1950s would have ; it is as if the filmmaker is saying that 1950s didn't have films that were critical of society : but a list of such films would be very extensive ( marty , high noon , ace in the hole , etc . ) . this snooty attitude , looking down at the past from the vantage point of a supposedly \" hip \" new age bothered me . afterall , my impression of this film , is that it really is a 1950s sitcom merging with a 1990s \" feel good \" type of sitcom , and nothing more . it is basically , a gimmicky film , which is the only new ground it breaks , selling an idea about the past that connects it with the present , but doing it at the expense of telling the truth about neither the past or present . the film is trying to say that the innocence of the 1950s must be merged with the social awareness of the 1990s and this can only be accomplished by the teenage heroes , who are not afraid to take chances and change the times they're in . i just didn't buy into this premise and was not convinced that i wasn't seeing anything but a superficial film . character development is a raising of consciousness that comes about only through a real inward awareness , a book can only act as a catalyst for that experience . what is offered movie-wise , is just the kind of empty gestures made to genuine problems , which can be found on tv programs from both yesterday and today . therefore it is just another empty gesture at culture , trying to be cute , letting the baby boomers know that it's okay , there're doing just fine . you can keep being materialists , just be cool about it ! there was no one in this film who understood how to bridge the past with the future , instead this becomes a film just like the sitcoms it parodies , which means it's just another escape film , unable or unwilling to delve deeply into all the real problems it brings up .",

bonham carter complain that the boys sure love their violence more than they do sex . the film eventually knocks itself out from hitting itself so much in the \" old \" noggin without really damaging its unspecified opponent-- society as a whole . the sheer nonsense of its storyline causes that knockout by relying on a ridiculous metaphor to make its point , too much glitter , and pitt' and norton' overacting ; what results is a jarring experience , enough to make you think without thinking that being sado-masochistic is the way to achieve respect ( it doesn't matter if this is meant to be a parody reflecting the violence in america : the violence is the thing in this story that the audience will remember most about this film ) . it succeeds in this venture only as a disturbing film , which makes the provocative assertion that those who are self-absorbed and mindless and go over-the-edge by doing violent acts are supposedly looking for hidden meanings in their life , which are given to them by false prophets , something that is happening currently in america to a great extent . but this film is too stilted , unconvincing , and inane to be the messenger delivering a warning about such dangers in society . but if its comedy that it is after , then it has some success in meeting those expectations , as the stars were able to project themselves into this story with enough animation to give the film a titillating lift . the more we get to know about the engaging soap salesman who is selling not only soap but a nihilistic philosophy , the more we learn how depraved he is . human lives are not part of this equation . a homo-erotic edge to their relationship is also hinted at , but like everything in this film , it is only superficially covered . the narrator suffers from insomnia , probably caused by his non-meaningful life . the utterly depraved tyler , exhibiting the ability to be a leader , with a need to offer sanctimonious maxims against the emptiness of materialism , such as , \" you are not your job , \" and the irresolute narrator , who is someone crying out for help and who is also someone ripe for being brainwashed . that all this is supposed to be funny is a matter of taste , though i think it is funny in a juvenile sort of way , where bad taste rules the day . the humor is catered to those who like their laughs coming to them shock treatment style . their alienation from society , supposedly , relates to those in the audience who also feel powerless about all the violence taking place in the country and now will have been amply warned by the filmmaker not to follow charismatic leaders and join cults that offer easy solutions to their problems , which should give the film a conventional reason for being made . the problem with the film's message , is that it comes via a film that is relying on the excesses of violence to put over its exploitive story , and then , to have this filmmaker be the voice of reason , is almost enough to make the average citizen who is concerned about the recent shootings in america's schools and the other sensational newsworthy violent acts , wonder what to make of this film , or to just barf at this outlandishly childish attempt to answer some very serious problems in such a mindlessly simple way . the fatuous simplicity the film offers for linking america's penchant for violence and sex , with the peoples' lack of fulfillment from meaningful jobs , is too much of a generality to be taken seriously . this response to what has gone wrong with the american dream is just as banal and wrong-headed a response , as those who would blame films such as this one for america's problems . at some point in the film , probably as soon as the fight club was started by tyler teaching the nerd how to fight and the club was then expanded into franchises across the country and evolved into a secret society of mayhem , the film stopped being smart and turned into a pointless nonsensical venture , that is not serious enough to take seriously , except it should be complimented for its imaginative visual style and kinetic energy it shows . the film's undercurrent philosophical sub theme stated by tyler , that \" it's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything , \" is an alluring one . if that were developed further along in the storyline , then there would be some intellectual challenges to a film that tries very hard to be nihilistic but fails miserably to make a cogent case for that belief or whatever it is trying to say , such as the drivel about this being a film about freeing the masculine soul from the shackles of a consumer society . i didn't fall under brad pitt' spell as easily as edward norton and helena bonham carter did , and therefore was not in a receptive mood for how the film was finally resolved . for me , this was a lightweight film that mistakingly thinks it's in the heavyweight class . what it offers for philosophy , is similar to the kind of superficial sound bites the tv news might offer to comment on its headline stories , as the news people seem to always play it safe and never take a radical position on the events they cover . what the film offers as philosophy is pseudo-philosophy , for a story that is more steeped in violence than interested in understanding its ramifications in a consumer society . it is just too easy to be against the fascists and the yuppies , and the emptiness of their materialistic lives . exploring that avenue , and not getting bogged down in showing another escapist violent film , might have been a more radical route to have gone down . it was very hard for me to see this unconventional mainstream film as anything more than a film that showed promise and had a lot of zip to it , but was disappointing in its scope . . . and . . . was certainly not a radical film .",

            "message": "there's not much in the way of thrills or surprises in this minor noir film , one that is able to combine a story about diamond smugglers and a smallpox outbreak in the new york city of 1947 . it is mildly diverting because of its able depiction of america's cold war paranoia during the early 1950s against anything foreign , as the film shows how an entire city can become terror stricken by something unknown attacking it . to make sure that you know that he is the heavy in the story , he will speak with a foreign accent . everything foreign in this film is either connected with something sick or with something dangerous to america . the action part of the melodramatic story was weakly told , while the noir characterizations of sheila did capture the desperate feelings of the subject , but it was not enough to overcome the overall inability of the story to have a heart to it . the mechanical acting by everyone , except for keyes , and the unconvincing action scenes made the film appear as the b film it was , despite the great noir camerawork of joseph biroc , who caught how dark the city could be for someone on-the-run .",

            "message": "a modern day western adapted from cormac mccarthy's national book award-winning novel of 1992 , which was accurately transferred to film by ted tally's script , as it kept the same laconic cowboy dialogue from the book intact , but was reduced considerably from the over three hour length director billy bob thornton originally shot it in , to under two hours , the length the people from miramax wanted it . it was hard to tell if the film was missing anything because of this deletion , but i did find the film to be directed with a skewed sense of rhythm . there were also too many scenes that failed to go anywhere , making the film dull at times . for a slow moving film , there was the contradiction of scenes happening too fast to be developed and fully realized . as a result , \" all the pretty horses \" failed to be engaging . if the filmmaker was aiming for an epic , he sure didn't get it in this sometimes elegaic film . what he got is something that plays more like a slick magazine photo shoot on the travails of being a cowboy , or as a touristy travelogue of what the old west was like , or as a stylish film that can't find what it wants to say and stumbles around in the grimness of a prosaic story about youthful aspirations . what it lacked was some emotional kick , as the scenes where the cowboys show off their spirited exuberance , seemed more portentous than not and just didn't jive with the unsure pace of the film . what caught my attention in a positive way was how pretty the picturesque vistas were and how the film gave off some good cowboy vibes about friendship and loyalty and had some good cowboy lingo to go along with all the pretty horses and with the hot-blooded senorita played by pen ? lope cruz . it becomes an on-the-trail film , with a love story and a revenge story filling in the life of the youthful cowboy drifters , as everything in the film gets boiled down to a simplicity that is too simple-minded to just accept without asking questions . \" how i was is how i am , and all i know is to stick . \" now that's some wicked cowboy talk 'pardner ! ' i found him to be the most interesting one in the film , as he adds his childish stubborness , volatility , homespun humor , tough backbone for fair play , silly superstitions about thunder and brings with him the hard-luck of someone who never had a chance in this world , giving this complacent film , seemingly so self-satisfied with its boring self , a chance to become energized by his maverick portrayal . when blevens is onscreen , the shallowness of the story doesn't seem to matter , because his coming-of-age story is better than john grady's . i'm not believing what i can't see . there might have been a good picture in this tale , but it just never kicked in . everything about the film felt choppy and not certain of the direction it was going in . the star-crossed lovers had no depth or sense of urgency in their lustful romance , and the film spent so much time trying to tie up all the loose-ends about the romance , and yet it had nothing much to say about it , as it always seemed hollow . though the buddy story was well-played between damon and thomas , as damon showed that he could be expressive and wear his changing feelings in a credible way . his problem was , even though he could physically do the cowboy role , i was never convinced that he actually was one . but the most disheartening thing about this film , was how out of whack it seemed , as the story had no staying power , it kept going off the trail , until it looked more like a marlboro billboard commercial than an enriching story of two decent young men living out their dream to be cowboys . something must have gotten lost in adapting the book to film , because i couldn't find where the heartfelt story was in all the superficiality i was surrounded by . the real star of this film was the landscape , i couldn't take my eyes off it . i think pen ? lope cruz can act ( at least she can in an almodovar film ) , but in this film she's around only as part of the beautiful scenery . i know matt damon can act and he shows in this film that he can let us look inside him , but i don't think he was up to being the romantic lead needed to make this film come alive . overall the film lacked a psychological breath to get us more involved in the characters . after seeing that , i didn't know whether to laugh or cry .",

            "message": "to make artistic films in a repressed country is very difficult , but to make documentaries for an amateur filmmaker can work simply because he is an amateur and is not expected to be after something politically dangerous , therefore he is thought of as less of a risk to those governments . kieslowski went from making documentaries to making this fictional film , and in some ways this film is semi-autobiographical , as it is about what power there is in the camera , especially for one who is an artist . philip is the central focus of the film , as he undergoes a transformation of personality . it seems that even though he didn't intend to , he hurts those who are not responsible for what he does . this is a political spoof on the artist's role and limits in communist poland and a comedy , as it comically exaggerates the film buff's growing pathology and voyeuristic tendencies . the power in the story was in the subtle reminders , showing that behind the obvious censorship , there is a real censorship problem for everyone , it is not only in the conflicts between the artist and the authorities-- but , for both the artist and the viewer who must demand that the truth and integrity of the work be preserved . poland is a good example of such a battlefield , with the then state-owned film industry in charge of funding projects , documentary films are sometimes the best records of such history , unless you have the artistic deftness , like kieslowski has shown , to make a film as wickedly ironical as this one is and get it past the censors . since the film's theme has been done many times before , and the comic efforts of the film were rather flat , what made this film provocative , was the absorbing performance by jerzy stuhr , who would become a regular in many of the director's later films , which spanned a career of over 20 years . and for showing that struggle through stuhr's eyes , the film is memorable , though it is not one of the director's top-flight artistic works , yet it is still worth seeing .",

            "message": "it is hard for me to believe that one of the world's greatest directors and one of my favorites , paul cox ( lonely hearts/my first wife/man of flowers/cactus/a woman's tale ) , made a film that was so saintly that it seemed to be without dramatic affect or chinks in its pious armor . this is not a commercial film , nor one that tends to compromise its serious tone in order to become more entertaining . it is a true story that tries not to flinch from the suffering it presents and from the altruistic virtues of the dedicated priest who is only interested in comforting those shunned by society because of leprosy . it eschews the tricks of filmmaking in its presentation of such a morbid subject , to its detriment . there is no bend in this film . in this beautifully shot film on the island of kalaupapahe , catching the lushness of the hawaiian islands , cox has taken the subject matter of suffering to a new degree of intensity and requires the viewer to be either fully absorbed in it or else it would be impossible to feel anything about such a miserable topic as 19th century leprosy ( hansen's disease ) . there is medicine for treating leprosy as of 1940 , but the undeveloped countries still can't afford that medicine , so the disease is still around . and as brilliant a study as this is , taking on such a difficult subject , this brilliance fails to amount to anything more than being a history lesson about hawaii and about those banished to die alone from that disease on an abandoned hawaiian island called molokai . he is so touched by this , that the first leper he sees , who is a child , he not only touches but embraces . unfortunately , the storytelling remains flat despite the superb character performance by the australian david wenham . in one scene , the most dramatic one in the film , lepers are tossed off the boat docked on the island's harbor and many of them drown . it is a scene of immense cruelty , but seems to have happened as if it were a dream and not real , as not much is made of it and the film just continues on without giving pause to that event . the film just couldn't say more about the priest except that he made conditions better , converted many to catholicism , and contacted the disease and died , relieved to know that the nuns have come at last and that there is another priest to carry on the work . these are fine accomplishments , but i'm afraid , they are not dramatic enough to energize this film . i felt anguished about all the piety i was seeing , but the film despite all its obvious flaws lingered with me for a long time afterwards and i'm not quite sure why . that is why i liked it better when the film had a chance to sink in , than i did when first watching it . it's a tough film to enjoy and i'm not sure i learned anything about suffering from it , that is if i was supposed to , but i do think i saw someone who i believe is an actual saint , and he was a spellbinding saintly figure despite being so unapproachable . it was the very best thing i have to say about a tedious film that i am glad i saw , even if i was not entertained by it .",

            "message": "guy ritchie has cleaned up some of the mess he made in this encore to his surprise box-office cult hit \" lock , stock and two smoking barrels , \" but has made the same kind of empty , semiserious/comedy/crime caper , with many of the same actors from that film . but , this time the story holds together better and is much more amusing , thanks in a large part to the ensemble cast who come and go in the film with seamless fluidity . it's a film filled with an assortment of colorful runyonesque characters from the underworld of crime , or illegal bare-knuckle boxing matches , or from the outcasts of society . this film , like the director's other one , has no strong role for a woman . the main plot is about a series of mishaps over a stolen diamond that somehow brings together a varied mix of characters who are after it or are inadvertently drawn into its disappearance , but the plot is really irrelevant , it plays as a mcguffin--this is strictly a character driven film , with all the characters being either lively in a cartoonish way , undeveloped , or forgettable . the movie will spin-off in different directions , telling each groups' story , until it all comes together in the last reel and plays itself out . the film is played mostly for the comedy and it throws everything it thinks is crazy into the comic mix , even a shaggy dog story . the language used has many expletives and is often hard to understand because of the heavy accents . the violence is brutal but cartoonish , as the film is styled much like a comic book . the rest of this heavily induced homage to musical video films , has a soundtrack that ranges from massive attack to oasis . ford's menacing psychotic performance , stood out as the film's most memorable one . pitt's self-effacing comedy was the performance i best enjoyed , as it gave the film a sparkling light touch ; while , dennis farina , also , was pleasingly comical and added some light touches to this cartoonish film . the only slow down in the film is in the opening moments , when the large cast of characters is introduced . other than that , the film moves at high speed , with all kinds of film gimmicks , from jump cuts to multi use of graphics . this is a film that thrives on controlled chaos as its signature theme . i would call it another dumb cult picture the director has made , one that suffers because there is no one in this film to care about .",

            "message": "happiness is not a film about happiness , because happiness is not real but imagined , therefore no one can stay happy in a world where sadness is the more prevalent emotional state . so goes the theme of this dark comedy , meant to shock and antagonize you into looking at people you cannot readily identify with , in a film that features a pedophile rapist ( dylan ) , a murderer ( camyrn ) , an obscene caller ( hoffman ) , a masturbator ( read ) , a russian immigrant thief ( jared ) , and an assortment of losers and lonely people wrapped up in their egos , as solondz's morbid sense of humor turns to new jersey's suburbs to explore the depravity of the human race . this is an honestly made film that refuses to compromise on its plot or who should be cast in it ( solondz refused the studio's offer to cast the pedophile with a noted star such as , william hurt , because he felt dylan was just right for the role ) . this film is meant for an art house type of audience , one that is able , as difficult as it may be , to see something in themselves in the characters portrayed on screen . i would wonder about anyone who could sit through this film and not be disturbed by it , that would just defeat its purpose . the audience i saw this film with , were mostly williams college students and faculty , and they laughed openly and freely at the parts that had an edge to it , where solondz was going for the laugh because he pushed the button as far as he wanted to go with a certain character and , in order to return to the intensely grim psychological mood of the story , he had to release some humorous energy or have the film drown in its own murky waters . the laughter was appropriate , and even \" hip , \" as it felt right to see this with an audience that still felt the need to be entertained when they go to the movies , and it didn't seem to matter if the laughter came about from the cruel humor it evoked , causing people to react as a group rather than individually . i found that most people in the audience appeared to be nervously silent ; and , there was at no time just one person alone laughing ( but , the best part , is that only one person walked out of the theater and no one hissed ) . happiness is a difficult picture to watch , there are no good guys or gals . the sisters all suffer from ego-centredness , and it takes an audience with a modicum of sympathy for each of them to get past all the vices each of them has , as each one in this story only pretends to be interested in anyone but themselves . this is a very solid film , that is well-acted , that is understandably not for everyone , yet because it takes risks on subjects that are tabu , and even though some of the risks seemed contrived and not a part of the natural story line , this is still a powerful film , one deserving of attention and intelligent critique , one deserving of thanks from those of us who welcome a true effort for the sake of art , even if the art has to sink into the mud to have its story told . many filmmakers have approached the subject of happiness by tacking on a happy ending to their films . that is not the case with this film , obviously . this film leaves you little choice , you can take this film as morbid and amusing as it is , or you can ignore it , or you can find no one in it that you feel some sort of compassion for , and therefore come to hate it . i came close to loving it , while not exactly loving it , mainly because there were too many scenes in it that left me with mixed feelings and messages . but close to loving it , means i liked it a lot for its honesty to subject matter and character . i did , however , think that these characters went too far in their portrayals for me to relate to them without either feeling sorry for them or despising them . dennis schwartz : movie reviews ozus @sover . net",

            "message": "an historical fantasy film that took eight years to make . this low-budget independent effort ( it had a whopping budget of about $20 , 000 ) , initiated from an original idea by kevin brownlow . the events are make believe ; the b/w film resembles an orwellian nightmare . this is where this fantasy film begins . it looks as if it is a semidocumentary , with scenes padded for dramatic effect and narrative . the power in the film is from the sheer force of the clash of ideas and the expressions coming forth from the nonprofessional actors . the film allows you the luxury to see things for yourself instead of being spoon-fed what to believe . the result was that seven minutes of the film were cut until recently , when brownlow regained control of the film and milestone released it for the first time in its full version . this scene of euthanasia was done in a most humane manner , by injecting them with poison , it was one of the most powerful and stunning scenes to behold . the filmmakers used mainly original rather than merely authentic costumes and props , and they refrained from using any archival footage , which would have been easy to obtain . they drew most of their sense of history from the 1940s by watching newsreels , but in the film they only used voice-overs from professionals who donated their services and used montages and close-ups to get the 1944 look they wanted . you can say whatever you want about their methods , but when you look at the results you feel the intensity and madness of the drama , it has a curious starkness about it that is very compelling . it had the mark of a true artist's stamp on it , even its amateur production values do not weigh heavily against it . even the ending of the film , as it comes to no particular conclusion , it just ends by allowing this remarkable work to be viewed for what it suggested , shows a confidence that the film accomplished what it set out to do . it certainly took the smugness out of anyone thinking that fascism couldn't surface in a country like england . it showed the final liberation by the americans , as an ironically gruesome scene , where collaborators were rounded up and executed . a call for pacifism , is the clearest message that could be heard from between the lines when all is said and done .",

            "message": "john ford's epic western about america and its racial past , is the quintessential american film about what it once meant to be american , more than any other film that i could think of , and that includes citizen kane . it is ford's best , one that is much more than the western it appears to be ; it is a film that is eventually about self-discovery , seen symbolically through the eyes of one man , john wayne . there is not one single actor in the world who could have played this part better than wayne . in the opening scene , he is only there briefly and does not feel very comfortable in that short stay , even when idolized by the children . ethan does not belong to either the white settlers or the indians . that he hates indians so much , yet speaks their language and feels comfortable with their ways , more so than he does with white society , makes it difficult to figure why he has so much hatred for them . his story is visceral poetry , a tragedy that turns ridiculous , as ford wanted it to be , and it has unexpected psychological twists to it that can be read into the story by one's own relationship with america . it is hard not to substitute his hatred for indians into a hatred for blacks , and it is easy to see how wayne's soul could be construed as america's soul . make no mistake about it , this is not an ordinary or very good western , this is undoubtedly a masterpiece of american cinema , one that many of the early 1950s film critics couldn't see . it is not that it is a particularly profound movie , but it is one that caught the emotions and the metaphors of a rich country with a paradoxical past and an intangible future . over-the-years , the status of this film has grown immeasurably , to the point that its anti-hero hero is now a fixture on the cinematic scene , along with the recognition that ford has created a work that searches deeply into a man's interior and into the country's consciousness . if there was a more perceptive western made , one that captured the visions of america better , i have not seen such a film . if there is such a film out there , i will take the liberty of using wayne's favorite retort in the film : \" that'll be the day . \"",

            "message": "carl theodor dreyer's emotionally intense masterpiece , the passion of joan of arc , soundly evokes the passion and resonance of france's heroine , the soul of her country , who was burned at the stake in 1431 for being a heretic and then in 1920 was made a saint , as if time can heal such wounds . not relying on the standard techniques used in silent films during that time frame , nor on the avant-garde and surrealist's vision of the radical 1920s on debunking the church , the danish filmmaker , dreyer , concentrated on making an intensely personal film , a film that eluded any known styles . the passion of joan of arc featured many close-ups of joan ( ren ? e maria falconetti ) and the judges , and used the symbols of the church to show the extent of its authority . though the film appeared to be shot without any long and medium shots , that was not the case . it just seemed that way because dreyer , for reasons of getting at the truth without any other interference , had made isolated shots of joan , showing how alone she was from her accusers , and from the soldiers and peasants watching the trial , and these shots became abstractions , allowing you to think of them as being solely close-ups . it is because of this style that we are forced to concentrate only on the main players and on the truth of the trial , and our attention is not diverted in any other direction . the genius of dreyer in assembling a cast that was perfectly suited for their parts is a major reason for this work of art and critically acclaimed icon in the history of filmmaking to be as absorbing as it was . he picked her because under her skin-deep beauty and makeup he saw her soul and the simplicity of her nature . no actor wore makeup , every attempt was made to make things seem as natural as possible . dreyer was rewarded with his choice for actress , by getting from her one of the greatest magical performances ever seen in the history of films . falconetti , interestingly enough , never made another film , but instead chose to go back to doing light comedies on the stage , except for a brief respite , where she repeated her joan role on the french stage . the rest of his casting was also inspired , this time by a mixture of professional actors and those chosen in the bistros , as he opted to cast for his english general , warwick , someone who in real-life was a cafe-keeper . the film's opening is a study in starkness . the contrasts between the two shots will be a recurring theme of the film : historical events will seem to be eternal . joan : \" i know nothing about that . joan : when i have done what god sent me to do i shall resume wearing a woman's dress . \" the filmmaking of the trial was so austere ; it was easy to believe that this was the actual trial taking place . the scene was so intense , that when it was being shot , all the stagehands brought her flowers on that occasion , and dreyer made the gesture of taking her tears gently into his hands in a moving tribute to her performance and how powerful it was . the film's spiritual sense of being is layed in the moral rectitude of joan and her willingness not to forego suffering . what captures one's imagination about dreyer's version of joan- and this film is almost completely his version- as he all but ignored joseph delteil's slight novel on which the film was based on- is that dreyer recognized that joan ultimately took a stand for all those who are opposed to social authority and who are determined to be true to their own nature and are prepared to offer whatever self- sacrifice is required . in contrast , is the honest gaze exhibited from the close-up of joan , who seems to be so much the better of a person than those pack of phonies she is forced to look at and be condemned by , that we are forced to see how the faces of evil are contrasted with the face of a good person , and dreyer's abstractions , of sticking to the shot he takes until you see what you have to see , until it grows on you , leaving you with a feeling of real sorrow as she is finally burned at the stake , in a trial that seemed in the film as if it took a day or two , but went on for about five months , in actuality . this is one of the most memorable films ever made , one that is hard to forget , as it ends on the bleakest of notes , with joan burned at the stake in front of a group of grieving spectators .",

            "message": "i have a great idea for a movie , one that can't miss . see , i've got coolio to do a song for the soundtrack , and about fifty athletes and celebrities to do cameo appearances . it's about professional basketball , so i'll release it right around the nba finals to guarantee added publicity . as for what the movie is actually about . . . well , that will all sort itself out eventually . i figure it will be a comedy , so i'll throw a half-dozen writers at it and take the best of whatever they come up with . maybe we'll put a gender spin on it , see if we can get some women out to see it , too . eddie is one of those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more than any other kind . twister , as inane as the script might have been , at least required some creative technicians ; mission : impossible , overwrought plot and all , at least involved genuine effort . eddie just sits there , hawking up a formula story without any laughs , and makes every possible bad decision when a decision is required . please raise your hand if that comes as a shock , and i will invite you to my all-night marathon of the bad news bears , major league , angels in the outfield , the mighty ducks , the big green , cool runnings and little giants . awful teams in sports comedies make miraculous turnarounds ; it's what they do . those teams usually involve kids , for a very sound comedic reason : it's funnier when they screw up , and they're more sympathetic . those which _don't_ involve kids usually have actual actors in the lead roles , for another very sound comedic reason : they generally have developed some sort of comic timing . eddie was cast under the misguided premise that it's easier to make basketball players look like actors than it is to make actors look like basketball players . perhaps that all didn't matter to anyone because there are so few punch lines , and because the whole film is one big casting gimmick . steve rash directs the spiritless script as though waving a flag of surrender and screaming , \" don't blame me , i just work here . \" perhaps it was patently obvious to him that eddie isn't a movie -- it's a cameo appearance that trips over a plot every once in a while . and those are the real jokes in eddie . nothing these individuals say or do is funny ; you are supposed to be laughing simply because you notice , \" hey , it's donald trump ! \" or \" hey , it's mujibur and sirajul ! \" it's difficult to decide whether eddie is so bad because it was so shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it can't even get the cliches in a cliche-ridden genre script right . neither is frank langella , and none of the athlete-actors have the ability to give whoopi goldberg anything to play off of . that leaves her to do her street-wise miss thang routine , but with no character , no sharp lines and no help . eddie isn't just a bad movie with a formulaic premise . it's a movie that makes you feel cheated and offended , because someone came up with a poster and a marketing plan to which they had to attach an actual movie , and you had the nerve to believe it was going to be a comedy .",

            "message": "screenplay : larry bishop . running time : 95 minutes . it is a tough call which annoying trend represented by mad dog time is more annoying . is it the cameo-rama , the insistence upon turning every scene into a celebrity \" where's waldo ? \" or is it the pulp affliction , the impression that a film spilling over with kooky , garrulous gangsters must also be spilling over with style points ? writer-director larry bishop has a terrible case of both in mad dog time , a simply awful piece of pseudo-cool tripe which holds the ignominious distinction of being the 1996 heir apparent to things to do in denver when you're dead as \" film most likely to make you wish no aspiring director had _ever_ seen a quentin tarantino film . \" however , in trying to combine ocean's eleven with reservoir dogs , bishop has cranked out a script with so much utterly ridiculous dialogue that you might not even notice that you don't care a thing about anyone or anything in mad dog time . gabriel byrne is the worst offender , trying to make his irish accent sound like brooklyn italian while blathering on about other characters in lines which mistake simple , inane rhymes and alliteration for cleverness . with nothing to say and a truly grating way of saying it , bishop resorts to trotting out cameos of guys who don't seem to belong on the same planet , let alone in the same movie . paul anka and richard pryor ( whose appearance seems not only unnecessary , but just plain cruel ) ? it doesn't matter that none of them has anything to do except show off a skin tone which , whether natural or induced by lighting or makeup , makes many of them look like prime candidates for the george hamilton memorial melanoma wing of cedars-sinai . at times , bishop seems to be making a desperate attempt to convince the audience that he is aware of the ludicrous excesses in mad dog time , giving goldblum a couple of meta-conscious lines which refer to characters , situations or dialogue . there are even a couple of moderately inspired moments , like having dreyfuss and reynolds , owners of two of the most distinctive laughs in hollywood , cackling away as they face each other . but when a film-maker spends this much time subjecting viewers to a story which exists only as a place to put his obnoxious rat pack stand-ins and have them mouth labored , grossly unfunny lines , he loses the right to pretend it's all a lark . the actors may have had fun playing versions of frankie , sammy , dean and the boys , but that fun isn't likely to be shared by an audience . mad dog time is a self-indulgent homage masquerading as hipster cinema . worse yet , it's like the cannonball run with cocktails and shark-skin .",

            "message": "screenplay : michael crichton , anne-marie martin . director : jan debont . the makers of big-budget summer movies and those who attend those movies appear to have come to an understanding , an understanding best exemplified by an observation i made while watching twister . several times during the film , there would come a point where it would become clear that the latest sequence showcasing industrial light & magic's computer-generated tornados was at an end ( it usually coincided with the dialogue once again becoming audible ) , at which point several members of the audience would stand up and quickly make their way towards the restroom . they were probably rather secure in the knowledge that they would not miss any crucial plot twists or juicy bits of character development during these brief expository interludes , and even if they did , they were not missing what they had come to the film to see . not a penny of the money they had plunked down would be wasted if they missed a couple of the characters engaged in conversation . it is this complicity which produces monotonous displays of technological prowess like twister , a film with a script that makes jurassic park's look positively labyrinthine by comparison . i suppose you have to give the creators of twister credit for coming up with a premise which involves people trying their damnedest to get close to tornados rather than trying their damnedest to get very far away ; it could have been even more tedious . the problem is that it doesn't take long before twister starts to look like a loop film . there are only so many ways you can film a bunch of vehicles driving through fields , over dirt roads , along highways before it becomes a chore to watch , and while director jan debont uses every swooping trick at his disposal , there is an awful lot of nothing going on during twister an awful lot of the time . there may be more driving in twister than there was in debont's debut feature speed . hunt is probably a better actor than bullock , and certainly provides the requisite cuteness factor , but bullock's heroine was able to comment on speed's improbability throughout the film with her priceless reactions . the trite love/hate relationship with which hunt is saddled is something no one could tunnel out from under , and neither she nor paxton has the big screen charisma to make the scenes without inclement weather anything but a monumental bore . every single character manages the astonishing non-euclidean feat of being less than one-dimensional , with characterization coming in such subtle forms as the fleet of identical black mini-vans used by elwes' corporate scientists ( as though you actually needed to see the three 6's behind his ear ) or the van halen tunes blasted by one of hunt's more annoyingly quirky cohorts ( philip seymour hoffman ) . films like twister are often defended with comparisons to amusement park rides -- that they make up in thrills what they lack in drama . i don't think twister even qualifies as a roller-coaster . yes , the visual effects are impressive , but it is impossible to watch them with anything but detachment , because as much as debont tries , he can't imbue a natural phenomenon with a personality ( he actually tries harder than he does with his actors ) . twister is a surprisingly gloomy and inert experience , with exactly two flashes of inspiration through its two hour running time . when they come , they only serve to remind you what the rest of the film is lacking : any sense of the fun that summer movies are supposed to provide . whatever one might think of the increasing mindlessness of effects-driven blockbusters , you'd think they could at least manage to entertain , or to give you a reason to come back when you get up to go to the restroom .",

            "message": "even the name before the film has changed , with disney shuttling the sequel from its flagship banner to dimension , the genre division of miramax ( apparently realizing the original had too few fart jokes to qualify as a live-action disney film ) . i only wish that with all those changes they could have rustled up a new screenwriting team . naturally this leads to amusing sequences of buddy befuddling opposing defenses as he makes like jerry rice . but wait , there's more ! the original air bud had good intentions and solid family values to spare , but it tied them up in such derivative and unfocused package that even the kids in the audience couldn't keep their attention on the precocious pooch . new director richard martin picks up the pace considerably this time around , but he can't do much to create any cohesiveness with this story . from moment to moment , it's hard to tell whether air bud : golden receiver is supposed to be an afterschool special , a john hughes film or an episode of rocky and bullwinkle ( though with considerably less wit ) . it's also hard to take seriously a film where a premise so bizarre is shrugged off as a given . this time around , buddy trots onto the field in his leather helmet and shoulder pads as though it were the most natural thing in the world . perhaps somewhere on the cutting room floor is a scene in which an arbitrator cites the \" air bud \" precedent . without such a scene , everything that follows seems a little insulting to the intelligence , and an indication of how lazy the screenwriters were that they couldn't come up with some creative way to land buddy on the team . i'm not pretending that air bud : golden receiver was made with me in mind . this one is a short attention span kiddie-caper which did have the young ones clapping and guffawing with some regularity , and perhaps that counts for something . it even features a few decent throwaway gags , including a llama named dolly and a splendidly off-key rendition of the american national anthem . there's just something vaguely desperate about this whole air bud franchise -- they have build not just one film but a series of them on what amounts to a better-than-average stupid pet trick . sure , it's harmless enough , but the frantic amalgamation of disparate elements gave me a headache . it's a bit frightening to note that the original buddy's trainer kevin dicicco is putting together another project , air bud : the next generation . perhaps in the course of teaching a new dog a new trick , he could teach a new screenwriting team one i'd really love to see : how to write a script that might appeal to someone over the age of five . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line \" subscribe \" .",

's performance . a little economy and subtlety -- skills hopkins demonstrates even when playing a wild man -- could have served gooding well . sadly , subtlety is one thing instinct has in very short supply . even viewers prepared to sympathize with the film's fuzzy embrace of the state of nature will find this more a philosophical tract ( albeit one with remarkably realistic animatronic apes by stan winston ) than a compelling drama . we all know man bad/animals good , which makes the decision to turn the humans into cartoonish villains even more perplexing . if there were a moment of real insight into a character , the rest of instinct's brainless cinematic thievery might have been more tolerable . instead , it lets breathing plot devices gab at one another for two hours between unnervingly familiar situations . thank heavens for the entertainment value of anthony hopkins' gloss on film's best-known cannibal . it's only fitting in a film that does plenty of cannibalizing of its own . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject \" subscribe \" .",

            "message": "screenplay : kevin smith . director : kevin smith . kevin smith's dogma is offensive . devotees of film industry scuttlebutt probably know that miramax , dogma's original distributor , put the film on the auction block after religious groups started turning up the heat . catholic organizations in particular declaimed the film's subject matter , many proclaiming it sacrilegious sight unseen ( \" i don't need to swim in a sewer to know it stinks , \" went one typical slice of logic ) . it won't surprise any of those folks when i say dogma is offensive . and i'm not even talking about the theological content . dogma should be offensive to anyone who expects more from a movie than two hours of a filmmaker's musings on every religious notion that ever came into his head . those musings are linked -- rather tenuously -- to a plot involving the very fate of existence itself . and oh boy , are there plenty of lengthy conversations . smith's eternity-threatening premise is probably meant to distract from an otherwise non-stop series of metaphysical/scriptural/doctrinal discussions on everything from the nature of god to religious intolerance . it doesn't . dogma is an incredibly long sit , a deep-n-profound dorm room debate of a movie without the benefit of cold pizza and beer . sometimes smith is simply snarky ( a deconstruction of \" the walrus and the carpenter \" as a critique of organized religion ) , in which cases he often churns out genuine laughs . when smith actually does get into the events of his plot , things don't get much better . smith has always been a filmmaker only in the most nominal sense , but his limitations are even more evident when he makes a half-hearted effort to add supernatural action to the mix ( radically shifting the tone from comedy to grim violence along the way ) . in a way , the low-tech fight sequences have their charms ; battles always seem to occur just outside the frame , and people come flying through the air from improbable directions . it's hard to cut smith that much slack , though , because you can't help but think his choices are based entirely on his limited visual vocabulary . he'll point a camera at people sitting around a table as long as you'll let him . i suppose the most frustrating thing about dogma is that , whatever your feelings about its messages , kevin smith is the wrong messenger . it's not that his insights aren't insightful -- he has some interesting things to say about faith , religions and self-righteousness -- but that he's pitching his weighty notions in such a scattershot fashion . life of brian could get away with borderine sacrilege because monty python played it smart and scathing ; dogma may be a sincere expression of belief , but it's too juvenile too often . smith opens the film with a disclaimer that the film is only meant to be a satire , then includes a comment to the effect that \" god must have a sense of humor . . . you simply _must_ do better than that if you want to turn sacred cows into fajitas . i hope smith feels better about religion after venting his spleen into a feature film . losing two hours to deep thoughts wrapped in limp jokes -- now _that_ i find offensive . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject \" subscribe \" .",

            "message": "screenplay : wim wenders , ulrich zieger & richard reitiger . director : wim wenders . wim wenders' wings of desire was one of my favorite films of 1988 . as corny as it might sound , i found it to be one of those rare transcendental film experiences , a beautiful and poetic tale of love and human wonder that left me feeling uplifted . i was unsure of how to approach the idea that wenders was making a sequel to this singular film , but i crossed my fingers and hoped for the best . unfortunately , all the good will in the world was unable to salvage faraway , so close ! wenders seems to have been unclear as to what made wings of desire special , weighing down a simple story with self-importance and a ridiculously convoluted plot . faraway , so close ! cassiel resolves to use his physical form to intervene for good where he was unable to do so before , but that resolution proves easier said than done . like wings of desire , faraway , so close ! shows us the angels' world in black and white , and opens with loosely connected scenes of the angels smiling knowingly over human shoulders as they work and worry . but unless my memory fails me , those scenes go on far longer in faraway , and they become extremely tedious . this prologue seemed to go on and on , and while it did provide information necessary later in the story , it could have been done much more efficiently . there are too many characters , many of whom are completely irrelevant to the story . the film's second act is by far its most effective . the marvelously expressive sander is great during these scenes , drifting into drunken despondency with genuine pain . wanders through the film making ominous but opaque statements like , \" time is the absence of money , \" becomes thoroughly oppressive in the final half hour . faraway , so close ! peter falk , who was so good in wings of desire as damiel's guide to humanity , is simply comic relief here , although a scene involving the distraction of two security guards is very funny . wings of desire was whimsical , but never dopey , and faraway has a real problem finding its tone . perhaps the most egregious sin in faraway is a preachy epilogue that seems only tangentially connected to the film we just spent two and a half hours watching . wings of desire was a kind of message film , but the message was skillfully delivered ; in the intervening five years , wenders seems to have had all the subtlety sucked out of him . the moments that do work in faraway , so close ! are mired in overplotting , and there's never any flow to the story . what's worse , it has tainted my memories of wings of desire . i think i need to rent it tonight .",

            "message": "screenplay : deena goldstone . director : robert allan ackerman . films like safe passage have been a television staple for years . every once in a while , one will sneak its way onto the big screen , usually on the cachet of a big-name star or director ( a la ordinary people ) , and occasionally a great performance ( like kathy bates in 1993's a home of our own ) can turn tired material into something special . susan sarandon is a big name who turns in a great performance in safe passage , but even she can't save this mess . there are simply too many interchangeably troubled characters wandering around shouting at each other . and except for the remarkably well-adjusted twins , every one of them is working through some sort of neurosis or involved in the storyline in some way . there are simply too many characters bouncing around in safe passage , and director robert allan ackerman often seems like one of the reporters who appears at the singer house running after a quote . with writer deena goldstone , he has created characters who are little more than sound bites , and none of their problems seem to matter all that much . with this lack of focus comes the sense that no one making this movie really knew what it was supposed to be about . it's about all of these things , and it's about none of them . safe passage is filled with little snippets of development which run into infuriating dead ends , but there isn't really a point . mag seems to be developing a friendship with alfred's shy girlfriend , one which might establish a kind of parallel to her parenting , but it's only a footnote . patrick's vision problems seem to exist only to give sean astin's izzy something to worry about , and simon is confused , but no more confused than i was as i tried to figure out exactly why he even needed to be part of the story . safe passage simply needed about four fewer sons and a real identity for those that were included . it does have susan sarandon , though , and she makes up for a multitude of failings . but as good as she is , she isn't given a handle on who mag is , at least not one which can carry the film past its scattershot characterizations . a movie like safe passage , in which nothing really happens , depends on the development of strong characters to carry it through . safe passage is simply a collection of character mcnuggets .",

            "message": "there is nothing quite as sad for someone who loves movies as watching a rookie film-maker who really wants to say something , but turns out not to have very much to say , or appears unable to say it in a way that connects . she has a sundance institute-approved screenplay , and all the studied quirkiness she can fit into 89 minutes . but krueger has created a predictable story with characters who still look like they exist on 3x5 notecards on her desk . manny & lo is a comedy-drama without enough of either . i suppose one of the things which irritated me most about manny & lo is that for an ostensibly original independent film , its basic premise has been done and done and done again . as comedy , think of ruthless people ; as social drama , think of last year's white man's burden . and those are just recent examples of stories which make the very psych 101 observation that kidnapers and their hostages aren't always so different , and sometimes bond to fulfill their respective needs . manny & lo doesn't offer much of a twist on the movie truism that if the plot is about a kidnapping , abductors and abducted will go from antagonism to uneasy truce to friendship . there wasn't a moment when i didn't know exactly where krueger was taking me . mary kay place , a much more experienced performer , turns elaine into something intriguing almost in spite of krueger . i think there is a tendency to give first-timers the benefit of the doubt on independent projects like this , because critics are usually aware of the limitations of time and money . i'm not sure that any of that matters to the audience . lisa krueger's intentions are good ; she wants to explore what can make a dysfunctional family functional , and how whether or not you perceived your family as dysfunctional can determine the effect it has on you . she also leaves threads dangling , introduces characters who do little or nothing to advance the story ( like cameron boyd as the terribly cute chuck , who hands out his signature to manny ) , and doesn't direct her script with an eye to making either the humor or the relationships as effective as they might have been . manny & lo is a slow , rather simple and not terribly entertaining film , and that doesn't change because krueger is inexperienced , or a woman , or not working for a major studio .",

            "message": "writers are smacked around so often and with such impunity in hollywood that it is perfectly understandable when a writer insists on directing his or her own material . it similarly makes sense , i suppose , for a playwright to want to direct the film adaptation of his own material , and herb gardner has been unusually protective of his plays . in 1986 , he directed his own adaptation of the goodbye people ; in 1996 , he directed his own adaptation of i'm not rappaport . clearly gardner is attached to his creations . in fact , he is far too attached . another director might have identified i'm not rappaport as a meandering play with one interesting idea , and given it the good tightening up it needed . gardner clings to every line and situation , turning out a sluggish and repetitive meditation on aging . i'm not rappaport is about a man's attempt to retain his dignity in spite of advancing years , and there are strong possibilities in the character of nat . walter matthau and ossie davis both give solid performances , obviously appreciating their own opportunities in rare leading roles , and there is an affecting sincerity to their comments about giving respect where it is due . that scene between nat , midge and danforth is noteworthy not just because it is the best one in i'm not rappaport , but also because it says everything gardner has to say that is worth saying . the relationships are not compelling enough by themselves to carry those scenes , and the point that seniors are under-estimated and mis-treated is made and made and made again . as i'm not rappaport wanders through the last of its 133 minutes , you may begin to feel that you have been sitting in your seat as long as its main characters have been alive . worse still , it leaves us with the depressing notion that the elderly should be seen and not heard . gardner didn't need to take us through over two hours of hoops just so that we could end up right where we started . well-intentioned and well-acted though it might be , i'm not rappaport is the product of a writer too married to every word , and a director too sparing with the knife .",

            "message": "mafia ! , like its predecessors airplane ! , the naked gun and hot shots ! , is a scorecard comedy . their goal has always been to throw as many puns , sight gags , movie parodies and bodily function gags onto the screen as 90 minutes could hold , operating on the premise that you gotta keep swinging if you wanna get hits . at the end of the film , a viewer's reaction is likely to be a subconscious evaluation of the jokes' batting average . if hits exceed whiffs , everybody wins ; if whiffs exceed hits , not so much . has two strikes against it before it even shows up at the ballpark , the first and most obvious being its satiric target . entrenched though the films and their situations may be in the cinematic canon , mafia ! just feels stale , as topical as a joey buttafuoco joke or a reference to bella abzug's hats . at least the godfather films will be well-known to most average viewers , though . the other major reference points are martin scorsese's mob-themed films goodfellas and casino . the number of gags baed on the latter film , including the opening credits sequence and the character of pepper ( pamela gidley , a dead ringer for sharon stone ) , is utterly baffling given casino's less-than-spectacular box office performance . references to more recent , more familiar films like forrest gump and the english patient draw big chuckles , while the casino references draw mostly blank stares . ( though curiously that title still appears on-screen ) , but no one gave nearly as much thought to the actual content of the film . the second strike is the \" trailer factor , \" which is always a danger with a broad comedy like mafia ! since virtually none of the jokes are contextual , and 90% of them can be conveyed in a matter of moments , the people who put together theatrical trailers and television spots are free to plunder the film for all the best laughs . it's easy to pull 120 seconds worth of \" a \" material from mafia ! , sight gags like a shattering poodle and an overweight ersatz river-dancer , but you're sadly mistaken if you think that's a representative sample . if you've seen that theatrical trailer for mafia ! , with its two-minute barrage of great bits , you've probably laughed about as hard as you're going to laugh at the whole 85 minues of the film . comedies like mafia ! are usually entertaining just for forcing you to pay attention . dozens of decent laughs hover around the perimeter of the frame , while several of the best moments come during the closing credits , including a great riff on the standard \" no animals were harmed during the making of this film \" disclaimer . it's the jokes abrahams places front and center which drop with a thud just a bit too often . as just one example of the lackluster writing , the \" guess what number i'm thinking of \" table in one casino scene is a joke swiped from vegas vacation . . . and abrahams offers plenty of moments worth a snicker or a grin , but ultimately that laugh scorecard just doesn't come out in his favor . for those of you scoring at home , that doesn't add up to winning offense . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line \" subscribe \" .",

            "message": "the term has at times been used to define any film which women tend to like more than men ( sleepless in seattle comes to mind ) , but in its strictest sense i define a \" chick film \" as one which deals with relationships men could only attempt to comprehend : mother-daughter , female friendships , and birth mother-child . angie definitely falls within this framework . it's got mothers , daughters , friends , childbirth and a dose of heartbreak to guarantee maximum lacrimal viscosity , and all these things may affect the target audience . i found myself impressed by geena davis' performance , but bothered by the obvious and excessive manipulation which never really pays off , and by some unfortunate mixed messages . davis plays the title character , bensonhurst , brooklyn resident angie scacciapensieri . geena davis' performance as angie is easily the best thing about angie , which is fine because it's also the most important thing . most of davis' roles to date have emphasized her comic talents , but angie confirms what thelma & louise suggested : that davis is a very gifted all around actor . stephen rea is also extremely slick and charming as noel , and the scenes between davis and rea provide many of angie's highlights . through its first hour , angie is an interesting and appealing character drama with real promise . the second half of todd graff's script suffers from two major problems . the first is that it seriously overloads on emotional high points . there were at least four separate points at which i thought that angie had reached its climax , and what made that decision the most frustrating is that none of them quite provided the catharsis that angie needed but always just missed . i got the feeling that hollywood pictures had tested several endings , found that the audiences responded to each one , and then decided to keep them all . consequently , angie loses its narrative momentum two thirds of the way through and coasts to the finish on its tear-jerking . the second , and perhaps more distracting , problem is a rather personal distaste for what i perceived as a sell-out in the change in angie's perspective which occurs at the end of the film . a speech angie makes to her baby surprised me by suggesting that angie believed her problem was thinking too much about herself , when i felt she was thinking about herself for the first time in her life . the fits and starts in the film's many climaxes left me wondering what it was that i was supposed to have learned from angie's story . it is a given that a film like angie pulls emotional strings , and that in itself is not a failing . manipulating our emotions is what films are supposed to do ; the best ones just manage to do it so skillfully that we don't notice or don't care . angie doesn't achieve that deft middle ground . it crosses its signals , piles on the pathos , and leaves its star to carry most of its emotional baggage .",

            "message": "screenplay : rafael yglesias and ariel dorfman . director : roman polanski . one of 1994's most unintentionally hilarious films was the adaptation of isabel allende's the house of the spirits , a bloated epic in which jeremy irons , meryl streep , glenn close and winona ryder were supposed to be playing latin americans . it baffled me that such casting could take place in an age where an anglo playing any other race would incite riots , and the casting of spirits was ultimately much of its undoing . roman polanski has made the same choice with death and the maiden , and again it was a very bad one . while as a concept death and the maiden is strong and intriguing enough to maintain interest , it is sabotaged by actors who often appear not to have the faintest idea what to do with the material . the psychological underpinnings of death and the maiden are a complex set of relationships and interactions which make for an extremely promising story . at its heart is paulina's conviction in miranda's guilt , a conviction which we should always doubt because of her paranoia and unreliability . unfortunately , as it plays out , the performances and direction make our choice far too easy for us . sigourney weaver is part of the problem , playing paulina not just over the top ( which is probably where the role should be ) but so far over the top that she falls off the top . weaver as a personality simply seems too strong to be so close to complete breakdown , so she makes up for it by contorting her face and snarling . he plays miranda as such a little weasel that if he's not guilty of this particular crime , we figure he must be guilty of _something_ . the part requires more ambiguity , and the very talented kingsley just doesn't deliver in this case . perhaps even more disappointing is the relationship between paulina and gerardo , which is remarkably intricate . all this is in the text , but somehow director roman polanski doesn't let it out . paulina never seems to love gerardo , while gerardo is mostly befuddled . the moments when they do reveal themselves , all in very stagy speeches , ring hollow because the same truths should have been evident in the performances . one scene shows what might have been , late in the film when kingsley makes a confession . polanski holds a very long take on kingsley , refusing to cut to weaver's reaction , and at that moment you genuinely wonder whether this is a guilty man spilling his guts or an innocent man giving the performance of a lifetime to save his skin . but moments later , polanski cops out with a too-obvious resolution . the performances in death and the maiden should have created a mystery . instead , the mystery is why they couldn't make the material work .",

            "message": "director : pat o'connor . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , nudity ) running time : 108 minutes . voice-over narration is a common cinematic device , particularly in nostalgic period films , yet i can think of few narrated films in the last thirty years which wouldn't have been better without it . narration tends to be a crutch , an attempt by a film-maker to be more \" literary \" which instead suggests that he lacks the patience to reveal the characters' psychology without short-cuts . inventing the abbotts is a pleasant period drama for a while , until the episodic story grinds to a halt as the actors sit around waiting for the narrator to tell us how they feel . the opening half-hour of inventing the abbotts is by far its best , energized by the awkwardness and buzzing hormones of its teen-aged principal characters . it is jennifer connelly's funny , sexy and sly performance as eleanor which provides the real spark to the first act of abbotts , her every scene punctuated by a wicked smile , a glimpse of underwear ( her own ) or a grab of the crotch ( not her own ) . then , thirty minutes into the film , connelly is banished from the narrative , and the whole production goes into a stupor trying to figure out what its about . there are really two separate plot-lines in inventing the abbotts -- jacey's attempts to live vicariously through the abbotts and doug's off-and-on romance with pamela -- but once connelly is out of the picture , the episodic story is sluggish and rarely involving . the single predominant reason for that lack of involvement is the narration , provided by an uncredited michael keaton to underline the action whenever and wherever possible . it becomes ever more obtrusive as the film moves along , first providing merely background information but eventually announcing the motivations of every character . it is the narrator who tells us how jacey _really_ feels about alice , not billy crudup's performance ; it is the narrator who make sure we understand how wonderful mrs . holt is , not the interactions between the characters . and , as though aware that they are under no obligation to convey their emotions through anything as mundane as acting , the actors simply don't bother . joaquin phoenix and liv tyler -- who needs to learn a different emotional shade before she's too old to play \" the virgin \" -- make a perfectly nice couple , but neither delivers a personality . both are pleasant to look at , and they might as well be modeling for still photographs . given the way fox has marketed inventing the abbotts to focus on its \" hot young stars , \" it's not unreasonable to think of them as models in a story . it's not that they can't act ; they're simply not given much of a chance to do more than look as warm and inviting as the 1950s suburban middle-america director pat o'connor ( circle of friends ) creates . the audience isn't given much of a chance either , which ultimately may explain more of my dissatisfaction with inventing the abbotts . as artfully made and sensitively plotted as it might be , inventing the abbotts ends up insulting the audience with its over-reliance on narration . tv's \" the wonder years \" became a parody of itself when daniel stern piped up every forty seconds or so to clarify significant details which required absolutely no clarification , and that's the way inventing the abbotts feels after 108 minutes . when narration makes a film feel more lazy than literary , as happens in inventing the abbotts , it's time to shut up and follow the old writer's rule : show , don't tell .",

            "message": "that should have been the idea , anyway . the edge is a wilderness adventure which also wants to be a psychological drama , but forgets to develop a convincing conflict between the two leads . in fact , there are precious few screen minutes of any kind between charles and bob before the are stuck together . for the most part , antagonism between charles and bob is presented as a given . after all , there's a beautiful woman involved , envy of wealth , stressful situations . . . what's not to be antagonistic over ? for one thing , the situations aren't all that stressful , thanks to an inherent lack of tension in the characters . every trivial piece of information he has ever read has become part of his photographic memory , making him a walking encyclopedia of primitive anthropology , basic physics , first aid , forestry , engineering and alternative cures for side-aches . as you watch charles fashion a compass from a magnetized pin and a floating leaf , or construct a squirrel trap from bent twigs , or go fishing with a thread from his sweater and a watch fob , you get the distinct impression that you're watching a portrait of macgyver as an older man . there's no reason to be worried about whether charles will make it . and it's too bad that there isn't more drama to the characters in the edge , because in concept and execution it's often a thrilling adventure . director lee tamahori ( once were warriors ) crafts some fine action sequences , notably those involving the survivors' ongoing battle with a mythically persistent man-eating bear . as photographed by donald mcalpine , the edge is a satisfying experience both visually and viscerally . intellectually , it's an ambitious disappointment . stories set in the wild usually assume that returning to a state of nature is the only way a human can survive away from civilization , which makes it refreshing to find a story which assumes that reason is an even more effective survival tool . it's particularly surprising that the writer is mamet , who has been known to have his characters turn animalistic while sitting at a desk .

            "message": "in my review of john sayles' 1996 film lone star , i wrote that my initial frustration with the film must have meant that i missed something . such was my confidence in sayles' storytelling that i was convinced i could find the unifying thematic thread if i just pondered long enough . in that particular case , i was right . sayles' new film limbo presented me with the same initial frustration , and the same determination to find the one piece that would turn the merely intriguing into the truly brilliant . and it just wasn't there . for the first hour , there are plenty of reasons to believe limbo could be the latest thematically rich cinematic sayles novel . here , alaska has at least two faces : the raw , blank-slate wilderness that provides escape and opportunity for new beginnings , and the tourist attraction that provides a sanitized version of that wilderness . sayles offers plenty of local color with his supporting characters , but it's the way those characters interact with the place that gives limbo weight . for half the film , limbo sets a tentative romance against a backdrop of civilization trying to claim one of the few remaining frontiers , even as residents who should know better keep searching for a predictability that just isn't there . i suppose you could see the second half as sayles' attempt to show just how far civilization has to go , if you were feeling particularly generous . even worse , the links to the first half's portrait of alaska at a cultural crossroads become tenuous at best . the second half is solid enough , but it's a jarring shift . instead of a novel , sayles has written two short stories slammed together in an uncomfortable fit . john sayles' films are always comparative pleasures in the bigger picture of filmmaking , with their smart dialogue and attention to human detail . sayles has also become a more visually interesting director with every film , turning in at least one hypnotically beautiful sequence of joe returning to fishing ( another triumph for cinematographer haskell wexler ) . he can say fascinating things both with his dialogue and his camera . in limbo , all those fascinating things just don't add up to a fascinating , unified story . limbo isn't a disappointment because he doesn't say enough , as in the ambiguous final shot . it's a disappointment because he tries to say too much . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject \" subscribe \" .",

            "message": "screenplay : jack bernstein , tom shadyac & jim carrey . director : tom shadyac . as many individual elements as i might analyze with any given film , my gut reaction almost always comes down to one crucial issue : did the film do what it was trying to do ? if it was a thriller , did it keep me in suspense ? if it was a romance , did i respond emotionally ? and if it was a comedy , did i laugh ? of all the film types , comedy is perhaps the most difficult to analyze ; either it works , or it doesn't . which brings me to this confession : i laughed at ace ventura : pet detective . god help me , i laughed quite a bit . comedian jim carrey's unique persona won me over in spite of a great deal of stupidity and some sluggish pacing . vanity projects are a dime a dozen these days , but they all apply a very similar logic , namely that if you let the star do what he or she does best , and if that star's audience is large enough , you'll have a success . i'm not sure whether the latter condition is true of carrey , but it is true that he's allowed to do what he does best . it has been a long time since i've seen a physical comedian who looks as comfortable on screen as carrey . his elastic features recall early jerry lewis , while his spindly frame and geeky self- confidence show traces of pee-wee herman . when the comedy is purely physical , the laughs are really big . the opening sequence features ace disguised as a parcel deliveryman gleefully shattering the contents of his package to simulate a shipping mishap . ace ventura boasts some of the most amusing slapstick in recent years this side of the zucker-abrahams-zucker films . it's considerably more erratic in its success when it comes to verbal gags . in fact , ace ventura is almost self-congratulatory in its political incorrectness , using homophobia and sexism as punch lines . the film drags between visual set pieces , rescued only by carrey's goofy delivery . part of the problem is that screenwriters carrey , tom shadyac and jack bernstein frequently seem unclear as to when enough is enough . ace's trademark mocking cackle , borrowed from carrey's fire marshall bill character from \" in living color , \" is funny once but not three times . a more telling example involves the theme song from the crying game , used perfectly once but then used again so that it just seems derivative . finally , one piece of advice for filmmakers : if you must use dan marino for a cameo , please don't give him too many lines . an isotoner glove commercial is about all i can take . there would seem to be little point to commenting on the supporting players in ace ventura , since for all practical purposes they serve as scenery with sag cards . she has a fun , over-the-top part much like her role in fatal instinct , but wisely she avoids trying to steal scenes from carrey . it just wouldn't work . in ace ventura , jim carrey establishes himself as a first-rate screen clown , one i hope to see again .",

            "message": "in a way , it has been a sad thing watching woody allen grow as an artist . i recall watching allen as bumbling would-be thief virgil starkwell in take the money and run as a youth every time it appeared on local television ; i remember the raucous laughter inspired by peeks at the naughtier everything you always wanted to know about sex and sleeper . in my heart i longed for allen to return to arrested adolescence in something besides his romantic life , to a brand of comedy even solid films like manhattan murder mystery and bullets over broadway didn't provide . in my heart , i longed for allen to become virgil starkwell once again . i suppose i couldn't have asked for more convincing proof than small time crooks that virgil starkwell is , in fact , dead . the abrupt shift in plot from caper comedy to fish-out-of-water comedy takes some adjusting , but it neither makes the film nor ruins it . as with most of allen's comedies of the last decade , there are just enough lively gags to remind you why it's still worth looking forward to his films , and just enough dead spots to remind you that he's just not the same . no shift in allen's sensibility has been more damaging to his sense of humor than the ever-increasing level of condescension in his films . there's one delightful moment in small time crooks that nearly re-captures that vibe -- allen trying to slip away unobtrusively at a posh party -- but more often the joke is on someone else . while elaine may is amusing as frenchie's brain-dead cousin , she's also a walking punch line for ray's sense of superiority . when the film gradually becomes a lesson in being careful what you wish for in case you actually get it , it's ray's world of simple pleasures that's held up as the ideal . i'd still rather watch any one of allen's last dozen films ( celebrity notably excepted ) than the majority of what turns up on the local multiplex screen . unfortunately , you keep getting the sense that he knows it , that he's grown so enamored of his ability to impress that he forgets what an incredible gift he has simply to make us laugh . there's a sequence in small time crooks in which the film's characters are interviewed by \" 60 minutes' \" steve kroft for a newsmagazine story . there's some funny stuff in that sequence , but it kept reminding me of the documentary style of take the money and run . in small time crooks , it's almost as though allen is trying to appease those aliens from stardust memories who cracked wise about enjoying his \" early , funny \" films . yet even when he's turning out a passably entertaining comedy , it's clear he just doesn't have any virgil starkwell left in him . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject \" subscribe \" .",

            "message": "screenplay : andy breckman and michael leeson . director : fred schepisi . a movie like i . q . is like a souffle . when you're trying to mix whimsy , romance , comedy and ( of all things ) physics together , the whole recipe can collapse under its own weight without the right chef . director fred schepisi made all the right decisions in 1987's roxanne , a film that could have been either cloying or tedious in the wrong hands . i . q . isn't quite as successful as roxanne , but it is far more entertaining than it has any right to be . while it's rarely laugh-out-loud funny , it's pleasant , low-key and consistently charming . it's not easy to describe exactly why i . q . works , because in many ways it's extremely simple and predictable . there are the standard complications , and none of them are particularly hilarious . i think i . q . 's greatest strength may be that it uses its premise to perfection . einstein isn't part of the story simply as high-concept gag ; love really does become a kind of physics formula , and its incorporation into the story is delightful . matthau is a marvelous einstein , a gentle matchmaker with a twinkle in his eye . the running commentary they provide on philosophy , science and love is a goofy little trick that turns them into an almost fantastical greek chorus . it's exactly what schepisi was able to do with roxanne : keep the tone light and coax fine supporting performances out of every last supporting character . of course , a romantic comedy is generally only as successful as the chemistry between its stars , so how do ryan and robbins fare together ? quite well , and that's mostly because screenwriters andy breckman and michael leeson take their time bringing them together . this is far from ryan's best work -- i thought she was coasting much of the time -- but a mediocre ryan is still worth a lot in a role like this . robbins , on the other hand , turns in one of his most appealing performances yet . many of his previous roles have been one-note jobs , either simpletons or sleazes , but ed is a warm and engaging character which shows that robbins has a bright future as a romantic leading man . their scenes together may not set the screen on fire , but they are comfortable enough together that the smiles just keep coming . i didn't expect much from i . q . , and it really didn't deliver all that much . i just had fun , and i left with a smile . it doesn't take a genius to realize that achievement is worth a compliment .",

            "message": "screenplay : alan parker , oliver stone . director : alan parker . mpaa rating : pg ( adult themes , mild profanity ) running time : 135 minutes . there aren't too many directors in the last thirty years who have directed one live-action musical ; alan parker has directed two ( bugsy malone and pink floyd the wall ) , and the latter was probably the last through-sung english-language film . well , one of them fulfilled the promise , anyway . parker has made evita a compelling visual spectacle , but his leading lady doesn't provide the same vibrant quality , even though it seems she is trying desperately to do so . one of the reasons andrew lloyd webber's musicals have been so successful is that they combine the appeal of grand opera with an accessible pop sensibility , and it would seem difficult to capture that operatic feel in a film . alan parker , however , has exactly the visual style required for a production like evita . the funeral scenes which open the film have an impressive scope , captured in mournful tones by cinematographer darius khondji ( seven ) , and there is a flow between scenes which is both theatrical and cinematic . evita is a story told almost entirely through the songs , and parker doesn't add any radical new interpretations with his direction . there are a few changes to the material , notably the addition of the new webber/tim rice composition \" you must love me \" which could have been dropped into any disney animated musical and been just as suitable , but other changes are more interesting and effective . some exciting arrangements also give new kick to webber's tunes . \" buenos aires \" gets a swirl of percussion to match eva's drive , and \" i'd be surprisingly good for you \" has a seductive swing . certain songs do have a dated , jangly 70s guitar sound , but the characteristic infectious bombast of webber's compositions holds up surprisingly well . what works far less well is the presentation of the film's three central -- and , for all practical purposes , only -- characters . antonio banderas brings his appealing swagger to che , as well as a voice which compensates for a weak lower range with some sweet high notes . che is the voice of eva's critics , yet he isn't a complete character , and neither is juan peron . that leaves madonna to carry the dramatic weight of evita , and it is plenty clear that she is eager to prove she can handle it . madonna understands determination , and she can convey it ; charisma is another story . you can't act a magnetic personality , and madonna is left to play benevolence without the force of will which makes her uncertain motives intriguing . the irony is that , for someone who has made a career of not caring about how people perceive her , madonna seems to want too much to be liked and respected as an actress . her evita lacks mystery , making alan parker's film a sweeping piece of visual theater with a star who wants to step into the audience and thank everyone for coming .",

( about ) you only wish you could see her try to say that with a straight face , to see what _really_ good acting is . there are plenty of words one could use to describe anaconda , but \" subtle \" ain't one of them . b-movies don't get much b-movie-er than this one , which doesn't mean it's a bad film . on its own level -- thanks to some hilariously ghoulish special effects -- it's actually something of a guilty pleasure . i offer a warning here that some of the following information might be considered spoilers , assuming you have been hermetically sealed away from pop culture and have never seen a suspense film . anaconda doesn't work very hard to buck the conventions of the genre ; in fact , it seems to revel in them . as one might expect , characters die . as one might also expect , they generally die in inverse order of their placement in the credits . anaconda even steals a page from 1980s slasher films by giving a monster a taste for those with questionable moral fiber . shoot a monkey ? the script serves up stock characters like the pompous prima donna westridge and the villainous poacher sarone with a giddy disregard for anything but plot , plot and more plot . not that the plot makes much sense ( beginning with why the narrator is along on the shoot in the first place ) , or even moves very briskly for a suspense thriller . director luis llosa ( the specialist ) often can't seem to decide whether anaconda is about the conflict with the snake or the conflict with sarone , and it proves to be a mistake to focus on the shipboard clashes when it means the characters are going to have to talk for any length of time . voight , whose perpetual sneer and absurd paraguayan accent make pacino's performance in scarface look positively subdued , goes madly over the top and looks like he's the only person having any fun . at least eric stoltz had the good sense to grab his check and spend half the film in a coma . so why , then , is anaconda more fun than glorified b-movies like twister or independence day ? because it never pretends to be anything more , and because it includes the kind of scenes a good monster movie needs : moments which leave you laughing even as you are going \" eeewwwww . \" sometimes a film only needs one really memorable scene to leave you feeling a goofy sense of satisfaction . anaconda boasts at least three , including a shot from inside the snake's digestive system ( the ana-colon-cam ? ) and it doesn't even matter that the computer-generated snake is nobody's idea of state-of-the-art visual effects work . a b-movie shouldn't be out to impress you . anaconda is simplistic , and could have used more of its monster , but it delivers . i'll look for my \" subtle messages \" in movies that aren't about 40-foot-long killer snakes .",

            "message": "making a movie about racism is virtually a no-win proposition . ninety-nine percent of the time , a film-maker will spend two hours making it excruciatingly clear that racism is bad , inspiring either righteous nods of approval or rolled eyes at the explication of the self-evident . we all feel good abour ourselves as right-thinking people , but we get the point already . what more is there to say if you're only making a cinematic sermon for the choir ? it's a risky endeavor -- you might find people chastising you for not making racism obviously bad _enough_ -- but it's the most potentially compelling . for all its flaws , american history x grabs you because it throws you inside the racist mind more effectively than any film i can remember . the center of that exploration is edward norton's creepy-smart performance as derek vinyard , a young skinhead we meet in two incarnations . those flashback sequences are by far the most effective , photographed by director tony kaye in icy black-and-white . remarkably , they begin from the premise that derek and danny are both intelligent rather than red-neck morons . derek is chilling because he's not merely spewing bile and epithets -- he's making racism _make sense_ like a master rhetorician . it's that kind of audience-baiting that makes portions of american history x so disturbing , particularly in a neighborhood basketball game sequence where kaye masterfully manipulates viewers into siding with derek and his skinhead cronies . the second shows us the reason for derek's incarceration -- the murder of two black carjackers -- in a moment more shocking than you might think movies can be any more . norton is perhaps at his most brilliant in this sequence ; his raised eyebrows of triumph as he is being arrested may be the most memorable single moment of screen acting this year . it's hard to imagine american history x ever getting made without the redemption/salvation angle , but it would have been much stronger without it . even more unnecessary is the contrived device in which danny is forced to write a history paper on derek's road to ruin , leading to a resolution that feels disappointingly pat . there's a grand sense of shakesepearean tragedy to the conclusion , but not nearly the intensity of emotion present as we're pulled into derek's racist world . we get that racism is bad . american history x works because it risks showing us why some people believe it's good . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line \" subscribe \" .",

            "message": "a couple of years ago , i began reading scott smith's novel a simple plan and never made it to the halfway point . there was nothing particularly wrong with the plot -- a moody cautionary tale about the resulting spiral of guilt and violence when three men find $4 . 4 million in a wrecked plane -- nor did smith's prose style offend in any way . it seemed to me a terrible mistake , one made identification with one specific character too explicit . intriguing though the premise may have been , i couldn't get past hearing hank mitchell's voice while watching his story unfold . sam raimi's screen version of a simple plan shows how easy it can be to improve on a novel when point-of-view is its only real flaw . only there is harm done . a simple plan offers an object lesson in any number of cliched moral bon mots : crime doesn't pay , there certainly isn't any honor among thieves , and love of money is indeed the root of all evil . it's a tale of what we're made of at our core , and how little it takes to strip away the civilization in a man like hank and turn him into a savage . that probably doesn't sound like the kind of material one usually associates with raimi ( the evil dead , darkman ) , a director whose camera often seems to need a dose of ritalin . he certainly tones down his hyperkinetic visuals , but he loses none of his energy , which is why a simple plan never feels like a simplistic morality play . he merely harnesses that energy into scenes of superbly crafted tension , where the moments before critical decisions linger with almost unbearable anticipation . raimi allows you to feel the weight of every bad choice , every life-threatening turning point . it's a thriller as full of genuine dread as anything a major studio has produced in recent years . it's also a thriller full of genuine pathos , thanks to a masterful supporting performance by billy bob thornton . as confused as he is physically grotesque , he provides the sense of emotional consequence most plot-driven thrillers lack . the one drawback to thornton's intense work is that he makes his castmates look weak by comparison ; bridget fonda's calculating sarah rings particularly false at times . a simple plan overreaches its grasp a bit during the final act when a sinister figure arrives to threaten the plan , but by then raimi and smith have gotten you so wrapped up in what their characters will do next that you're willing to follow wherever they lead . smith's first-person narrative in written form made this a tale of one man's descent . on the screen , a simple plan lets you identify with every character and experience the chilly , chilling dark night of several souls . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line \" subscribe \" .",

            "message": "screenplay : erick zonca and roger bohbot . director : erick zonca . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 112 minutes . many films have traced the arc of a romantic relationship in which the two principals , despite initial appearances that they are a perfect pair , are destined never to be happy together . the dreamlife of angels is the first film i can recall which traces the arc of a platonic friendship in the same terms . sparked by two superb performances in complex roles , it's as affecting and involving as any tale in which the doomed couple are romantic partners instead of pals . the dynamic between the two central characters works from the outset only because they are so carefully , beautifully drawn by erick zonca and roger bohbot . their playful irreverence makes for some entertaining scenes , and allows the two lead actresses to develop a believable chemistry . that kind of chemistry is critical to a story about a relationship -- if isa and marie don't seem like ideal best friends when they first get acquainted , the rest of the dreamlife of angels becomes utterly irrelevant . it's just as important that the appearance of an ideal pairing proves deceiving , and the film works just as well revealing that truth . the character study of the dreamlife of angels is so strong that it's easier to overlook its short-comings : a drawn-out prologue before the two women meet , under-developed supporting characters , and a third act which takes an unnecessarily melodramatic turn . zonca's minimalist direction never gets in the way of the performances , but it also does little to complement them . in fact , the story might have worked even better as a two-character stage play . that's not to take anything away from the effectiveness of those characters in the film , or the skilled actresses who bring them to life . it's a thoroughly compelling exploration of female bonding and un-bonding , a \" chick flick \" turned on its head . the disintegration of a friendship has rarely felt quite so tragic . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject \" subscribe \" .",

's story a comedy rather than a tragedy . after every clumsy take becomes not simply a paradigm for self-delusion , but a reminder that sometimes process is as important to art as product . the sincerity with which wood speaks to welles as an equal , and his determination to stay true to his vision , make him anything but pathetic . yet burton manages to tell another story in ed wood , that of the curious friendship between ed and bela lugosi . it is truly an example of mutual need--wood needs lugosi to lend his movies credibility ; lugosi needs wood to give him work , any work--but it's also something even more touching . it is respect which is the greatest gift ed gives him , and laundau's portrayal of his slow return to humanity is one of the finest pieces of acting this year . it is ed wood's niftiest accomplishment that it links these two stories so effortlessly . ed wood's uniquely wonderful naivete comes from the fact that he never fully grasps that hollywood was a business first . he is unable to understand how lugosi could be unable to find work , because to ed , his talent is all that should matter . ed wood is occasionally quite slow-moving , and loses much of its steam in its final twenty minutes . but the affection in burton's telling of this tale is infectious , and makes one wish more talented contemporary filmmakers were as relentlessly individual .",

            "message": "screenplay/director : quentin tarantino . according to all evidence , pulp fiction is going to be one of those movies that turns people into incarnations of beavis and butthead ; either it \" sucks \" or it \" kicks ass , \" apparently with no tenable middle ground . this of course is the natural course of things for films as unique as pulp fiction . quentin tarantino's stunning sophomore effort deserves better . it is the kind of film , imperfect though it may be , which should inspire discussion about how exciting the medium can be . there are more moments in this one film which awed me to silence than in every other 1994 release combined , and while its faults may not allow it to stand as the year's best film , it's certainly close . pulp fiction is divided into segments telling interlocking tales about a group of shady characters . this is what must be said about pulp fiction : few films in the last fifteen years have left me so charged with the pure gonzo thrill of movie-making . has there been a more erotically charged conversation than that between vincent and mia at a gaudy 50's-style burger joint ? has the flushing of a toilet ever caused such a combination of laughter and suspense . and has any scene caused an entire audience to squirm quite so violently as a spectacular moment involving an overdose victim and a six inch hypodermic needle ? quentin tarantino refuses to let any moment just sit there ; relationships between characters crackle with intensity , and darkly comic punch lines are spit out like bullets . i left pulp fiction feeling as though i had not simply watched a movie , but * experienced * one . i was exhausted . however , it would be a mistake to suggest that there is nothing to pulp fiction but its visceral impact . tarantino does not place his characters in a universe of amoral anarchy ; as reservoir dogs first indicated , he is fascinated with loyalty and moments of improbable selflessness . two such moments provide the moral backbone of pulp fiction . both are showcases for career performances . willis is better than his previous work had ever so much as hinted at , while jackson delivers what is quite simply the best performance in an american film this year . it is at these moments when pulp fiction , for all its frantic energy , reveals its real message : even in a world this violent , salvation is possible . the only real problem with pulp fiction is a significant lag between the marvelous middle segment and jackson's tour-de-force monologue . but tarantino brackets that lull with such sheer cinematic glory , that the sour taste doesn't linger . pulp fiction is violent , profane and filled with addicts , racists and killers . at the same time , it may be one of the most moral stories the big screen has seen in years . that tarantino was able to pull off that little maneuver says as much about his talent as a dozen palmes d'or .",

            "message": "ron shelton appears to understand two things better than any other contemporary film-maker : sports , and kevin costner . put a sports movie in the hands of almost any other director , and you get the feeling that they're just biding their time until the big climactic game/fight/match ; put kevin costner in the hands of almost any other director , and you find the thin-voiced actor placed in the uncomfortable position of playing commanding and heroic . when the two men joined forced previously , for 1988's bull durham , the result was one of the best and funniest sports films ever , and probably costner's best performance ever . that casually charming costner is re-born in tin cup , yet another superior shelton sports film overflowing with pleasures . there are a lot of kevin costner bashers out there -- i have been known to be one of them -- who have forgotten that he became a star in films like bull durham and field of dreams which allowed him to be warm , funny and approachable . that is too bad , but it happened because costner himself and plenty of other directors forgot , too . tin cup is a reminder of costner at his best , boyishly handsome and with an equally boyish temperament , and he has so much effortless fun playing roy that it is nearly impossible not to have fun with him . he is like a little league player who never out-grew little league , always swinging for the fences and always eager to please . costner manages to make immaturity incredibly endearing . shelton has given costner a great character to work with , and has fashioned a great story around that character . bull durham was so authentic in its detail about minor league baseball that it was easy to overlook the fact that shelton made a film that wasn't just about baseball . it was about playing a game because you loved it so much you couldn't imagine doing anything else , and the frustration of seeing a player with less love ( tim robbins' nuke laloosh ) have so much more talent . roy's problem is that he understands all too well that fans don't watch professional sports to see the steady hitter , the guy who runs the precise receiving route , or the guy who can make all his free throws ; they watch to see the home run hitter , the flashy runner , or the 360 degree dunk . that is what makes a ron shelton sports movie better than anyone else's sports movies : he has a better understanding of the way fans and players think . he also knows how to create scenes which sing with unexpected wit . shelton also gives his actors subtly eccentric characters to play , with tremendous results . only the leisurely , golf-like pace of tin cup proves troubling -- at 135 minutes , it has a few too many dead spots , and a rather unnecessary tangent involving roy's stripper ex-girlfriend . but by the time tin cup ends , those moments will have been forgotten . you'll be thinking about how smartly and cleverly ron shelton can write a sports film , how good kevin costner can be in them , and how many sports might be left on which they can collaborate .",

            "message": "screenplay : robert rodat . producers : steven spielberg , ian bryce , mark gordon & gary levinsohn . director : steven spielberg . mpaa rating : r ( intense wartime violence and gore , profanity ) running time : 170 minutes . the first and last image in saving private ryan , a war story of shattering visceral and emotional force , is an american flag waving in the breeze . it's a bold choice , one that defines what makes this film so unique among modern war films . for over 25 years in the post-vietnam era , american war films have reminded us over and over again that war is a chaotic and futile endeavor characterized by gleeful brutality and morality of convenience . even the most well-received examples -- the deer hunter , apocalypse now , platoon , full metal jacket -- trafficked in violence and psychological devastation as though they were the only facets of the wartime experience worth exploring . the stories were less about the people in war than about war itself as an existential disease . saving private ryan may be the most mature war film ever made , because it combines the horrifying realism of contemporary war films with the sense of purpose conveyed in the patriotic adventures of the 1940s . the reluctance of miller's men to take on this mission is understandable , since it's amazing enought that any of them survived the initial assault on the beach . it's hard to begin describing the film artistry involved : that half hour is disturbing , surreal , at times darkly humorous , simultaneously too intense to watch and impossible _not_ to watch . if it had been spielberg's intent to play a game of wartime can-you-top-this with his contemporary peers -- and you never believe for a second that it was -- the contest wouldn't even be close . cinematic warfare has never been more agonizing . nor , in its way , has it ever been more human . hanks delivers his finest performance yet as miller , whose trembling hand betrays demons his men can only guess at ; barry pepper radiates steely-eyed confidence as sharpshooter pvt . the most harrowing performance , however , comes from jeremy davies as cpl . in one brilliantly acted scene , upham's psyche vanishes into the rubble . this being a tale of the \" last noble war \" in american history , it's also about heroism , though not in a conventional sense . faced with an assignment everyone considers fubar -- an acronym for the saltier version of \" fouled up beyond all recognition \" -- miller and his men are forced to make it make sense . this is the sort of heroism saving private ryan examines : not the heroism of men fighting an obviously evil enemy for an obviously just cause , but the heroism of men taking responsibility for doing their duty to the best of their ability . it becomes the ability to make meaning from the hell war always has been and always will be . steven spielberg , who set a new standard for himself with schindler's list , actually manages to raise that standard in saving private ryan , which isn't to say that it's a perfect film . john williams score may not be as intrusive as it was in amistad -- but then , how _could_ it be ? -- but it still underscores scenes best left silent , and one late scene is a bit too reminiscent of schindler's \" i could have done more \" speech . yet even in that moment spielberg drives home his unique , provocative vision . late in the film , a character tells ryan , \" earn this , \" handing him the responsibility for making his life -- and the lives of those who died for his sake -- matter . that waving flag which opens and closes saving private ryan is a challenging sort of patriotism , free from self-righteous over-simplifications like \" good war \" vs . \" bad war . \" with the grace and power of great cinema , spielberg makes accountability in the midst of tragedy absolutely individual . he forces you to stare inward and ask whether you've earned this -- this life , this country , this freedom . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line \" subscribe \" .",

            "message": "in 1990 , the mpaa introduced the nc-17 rating to provide an outlet for legitimate adult fare--non-pornographic motion pictures with content deemed too strong for the under-17 crowd . the first movie released with an nc-17 was henry and june , whose financial failure was widely blamed on the new rating . after that , all potentially-lucrative films receiving an nc-17 made the cuts required by the mpaa to earn an r . now , in 1995 , there's showgirls , the most significant test of the nc-17's commercial viability to date . helmed by paul verhoeven ( total recall , basic instinct ) and written by joe eszterhas ( jagged edge , basic instinct ) , this movie is going into wide release with the adult rating . too bad it's one of the worst films of the year . curiosity will undoubtedly pull in a fair number of movie-goers , especially on the first weekend . other than that , though , there's nothing about showgirls to lure viewers . this film is like a shiny , red apple that's rotten to the core--despite slick direction and a glossy sheen , it reeks of decay . showgirls isn't a good drama , a good thriller , or even good pornography . it's hard to imagine that the picture will appeal to anyone , and unclear whether there's any future for the nc-17 rating if showgirls rightfully bombs at the box office . saved by the bell actress elizabeth berkley has the lead role , and her lack of feature experience shows . she was obviously chosen more for what she would show than for acting ability . and , by the end of the two-hour plus running time , there's very little berkley hasn't given the audience at least a peek at . verhoeven has never been a subtle director , and his fixation with naked body parts makes one wonder if he might not have potential as a hard-core director . showgirls is a cold , soulless , misogynistic motion picture . there isn't anything to like about the thinly-drawn , stereotyped characters , and the situations they drift through are far from engrossing . showgirls has one aim only : to suck in money . artistic integrity , intelligent scripting , heart-felt acting , and sincere film making are all absent . everything--from the overall plot to individual lines of dialogue--is predictable and poorly-written . as bad as the first ninety minutes of this film are , the last thirty are worse . the closing quarter of showgirls is distasteful in every way--from its gratuitous violence to its illogical plotting . the final scenes are intended to teach something about ethics , but that's a hypocritical stance for a motion picture without a moral compass . this year's other picture about lap dancing , atom egoyan's exotica , was everything showgirls is not : sensitive , intelligent , erotic , and well-acted . it's almost a disservice to the fine canadian film to mention it in the same review as the verhoeven/eszterhas monstrosity , but certain superficial similarities are too obvious to ignore . but , where exotica was full of mystery and emotion , showgirls is a hollow shell--false , mechanical , and entirely despicable in intent and execution .",

            "message": "before i do the written equivalent of tearing this film into shreds and dumping the remains where they belong , i'll be honest enough to admit that boys around the age of ten seemed to enjoy rookie of the year very much . the movie is clean enough to be considered a family film , although i doubt many of the bored girls and disinterested parents in the audience would endorse it . personally , i think that family films should be enjoyable for everyone in the family , not just a select sex/age group . unfortunately , their number is dwindling as they are replaced with dim-witted , poorly-conceived dross like this picture . as the title suggests , rookie of the year aspires to be a baseball movie . in this , it fails in almost every respect . fans of the game will be horrified by the lack of attention paid to the nuances and subtleties of baseball , while those who don't like \" america's pastime \" will probably find this film uninspiring , unimaginative , and uninteresting ( all of which it certainly is ) . a gargantuan misstep is that rookie of the year tries a few stabs at drama while its outrageous setup allows only for the most absurd of comedies . maybe the monty python troupe could have done something with the premise , but it's way beyond daniel stern's meager abilities . as an actor , stern has a flair for comedy ( as showcased in home alone and city slickers ) , but as a director ( at least from the evidence we're given here ) , he is inept . unfortunately , as far as this movie is concerned , daniel the actor doesn't do much better than daniel the director . his character , that of a wacky pitching coached who got beaned once too often , is easily the most potentially-amusing member of the cubs , but stern tries too hard for laughs and ends up getting little more than grimaces . this movie is bad even as a fantasy for cubs lovers and mets haters . there's not enough substance here to give meaning to the \" big game \" between the two clubs . added to that , the mets are portrayed as such a ridiculously over-the-top gang of thugs and losers that it's impossible to hate them . besides , given the team's current woeful brand of real baseball , setting this team up as the heavy is a huge mistake . rookie of the year presents a perfect opportunity for a line of cameos by current and ex-major league players . personally , i can't stand the man , but in a film so indulgent of wrigley field fantasies , the omission of carry is profoundly felt . instead , all we get is an embarrassingly silly john candy doing his best harry imitation--and a pale one it is , at that . this is a genuinely insulting movie . it takes every formula and cliche and binds them together into a package that doesn't work . things might have been better if the director and screenwriter had shown a hint of aptitude , but nothing like that is forthcoming . most baseball films , even the best of them , are formula-driven . robert redford hitting a home run in the bottom of the ninth is pure fantasy , not to mention absolutely predictable , but it's still a great movie moment . rookie of the year lacks this kind of style , and its comedy is so daft that it can't compete with the likes of major league ( which was , at best , a mediocre film ) . of course , the characters are stock , and the actors aren't able to do anything with them . thomas ian nicholas , in the title role , manages to make his character as annoying and unpleasant as possible . i'm sure i'm not the only one who wished someone would plunk that kid when he was dancing off first base and making fun of the dodgers' pitcher . he puts an effort into bringing to the surface several facets of what is essentially a two-dimensional character , but there's not much that busey can do to save chet steadman . however , a purpose served by the presence of busey is to give a yardstick by which the lackluster performances of the rest of the cast can be measured . if you're a ten-year-old boy who wants to vicariously live out the fantasy of playing for a big-league ball club , this might be a movie worth seeing , but for anyone else , it represents a blunder as big as a hanging curve ball . in baseball , you get three strikes and you're out , but in the making of rookie of the year , daniel stern has gotten far more than that . nearly the only good thing about this film is that i saw it in an air-conditioned theater on a day when the thermometer had nudged above the 100 degree mark . nevertheless , half-way through the movie , the heat outside was starting to look good .",

( no , terminal velocity is nowhere near that quality level . ) i have never admired charlie sheen as an action hero . he does the wise-cracking okay , and he's not bad in a fight , but there's one major asset he lacks : an accent . how can you take anyone serious in this sort of movie when they sound like they were born in this country ? even steven seagal has an accent of sorts . . . it's called a monotone . ah , but then there's nastassja kinski , and she has the accent . that doesn't really fit , though , because he gets top billing . sheen isn't the action hero or the token beefcake . he's the comic relief . then again , maybe not . . . the plot takes preposterousness to new levels . i doubt even forrest gump would be able to suspend his disbelief enough to swallow what this movie has to offer , worm and all . the dialogue is as hard-boiled as it comes . these are the kinds of lines that once made dime-store novels so popular . and it's not just occasional . \" pack the bags--we're going on a guilt trip \" happens to be my favorite , but there are lots more to choose from . terminal velocity has an unfair advantage over many other bad movies : it's too raucous to put anyone to sleep . there are enough explosions , gun fights , and loud music to arouse the attention of even the most disinterested viewer . laughably preposterous--yes ; boring--no . it's an experience , all right--albeit one that most people can do without .",

            "message": "nothing is sadder than seeing a once-beloved movie series keep churning out sequels long after its time is past . three more sellers' panther movies subsequently were released ( the return of the pink panther , the pink panther strikes back , and the revenge of the pink panther ) , none as good as the first two , but all worthwhile diversions . unfortunately , sellers' death in 1980 failed to stem the tide of the films which , at that point , should have been ended . the trail of the pink panther and the curse of the pink panther were produced , neither of which was worth the price of admission . benigni , star of the farce johnny stecchino , is adept when it comes to physical humor , and his abilities are highlighted here in four or five scenes that include heavy doses of slapstick . however , while these produce some laughter , they are largely regurgitations of material from previous pink panther entries . beyond copying peter sellers' style , benigni has little to do , and less by which to distinguish himself . i guess the years have taken away his edge . once , we demanded superlative films from him ; now , we're just hoping for something somewhat entertaining . the opening titles are as uninspired as those for any of the pink panthers . although they give the big cat his first opportunity to mix with live actors , the interaction is stale and fails to stir a chuckle . it's sad , because i always considered the pink panther to be one of the funnier cartoon characters , both on his own and introducing the clouseau movies . not only is the animated panther not up to snuff , but the opening theme is sub-par as well . at least the end credits retain the original music in its full orchestral splendor . there's very little about this movie that isn't disappointing . one might make the foolish assumption that for a pink panther film to be produced out ten years after the last disastrous entry in the series , there had to be a creative reason--preferably something new and inventive . instead , however , we are lumbered with this cobbled-together effort . if there's a mercy , it's that son of the pink panther should finally put the clouseau family to rest . then again , that's what i thought about the curse of the pink panther .",

( maybe he should consult with arnold schwarzenegger , star of this summer's eraser . ) unfortunately , questions of morality are of secondary importance to a film that emphasizes its death wish aspects . the most energetic parts of thinner are those that focus on billy's revenge , and this is no accident . the makeup that transforms 175-pound robert john burke into his 300-pound character is embarrassingly unconvincing , especially in the wake of the much better job done to expand eddie murphy's waistline in the nutty professor . for that matter , the prosthetics on michael constantine and several other actors don't look all that impressive , either . on top of its other problems , thinner is too long . there's not enough story here for a forty-five minute motion picture , not to mention something twice that length . as a result , there's a lot of pointless running around , a protracted dream sequence , and some meaningless \" character building \" scenes that don't build anything . on the whole , though , a slimmer running time , not to mention an astute script , would have made thinner go down a lot more smoothly .",

            "message": "their latest offering is something called china moon , a film noir featuring the unlikely pairing of ed harris with madeleine stowe . this movie , which bears a 1991 date , is not like a fine wine--age has not improved it ( in fact , in the three-plus years since it was filmed , ms . stowe has gone to some lengths to distance herself from the production ) . after exchanging a few bad lines of dialogue , rachael and kyle recognize the attraction , although they don't act on it--at least not immediately . as far as thrillers go , this one starts off dead in the water . the first forty minutes are not only dull , but dull in a manner that calls attention to the bad dialogue and obvious plot points . there are instances when the relevance of some little detail is called attention to by everything except a big neon sign saying : \" look ! the second half of china moon almost redeems the first . despite numerous coincidences designed to stretch one's suspension of disbelief to the breaking point , and several truly dumb plot contrivances , it's actually fun to follow all the twists and turns--even if too many of them are predictable . the ending , which displays a willingness to try something a little different , is another source of potential forgiveness . then there are the actors . if you don't listen to 75% of the dialogue ( which sounds like it was written by a seventh-grader hooked on dime-store potboilers ) , the two leads give enjoyable performances . ed harris is generally convincing , as is madeleine stowe , although it should be pointed out that neither role demands a great deal of range . these are pretty much single-dimension performances : the strong , silent detective and the scared , abused wife . on the other hand , the supporting cast doesn't have a clue . charles dance gets into his role as the detestable husband , never once eliciting a glimmer of sympathy from the audience , but his performance seems almost clinical--a sort of act-by-numbers job with a very , very bad southern accent . benicio del toro is absolutely dreadful , and almost every scene that he's in turns into an endurance contest for those watching . basically , for anyone who just wants to see a truly convoluted thriller without considering the logic or intelligence of the serpentine track of the story , china moon isn't a terrible choice . the film is good only by b-movie standards , and as such it offers something in the way of lowbrow entertainment . enjoyability depends largely on how deeply the viewer can immerse him- or herself in the movie's murky waters--something that's an iffy prospect with the combination of mr . del toro's acting and screenwriter roy carlson's often-inane script .",

            "message": "although several years in the past , his disastrous version of the bonfire of the vanities is still fresh in the minds of everyone unfortunate enough to have endured it , and his \" return \" to the thriller genre with raising cain wasn't a whole lot more promising . carlito's way is a step up , but this is not the same depalma who got the adrenaline moving with the untouchables . carlito's way has a number of superbly-directed action sequences , and there are moments of absolute brilliance , but these are connected by a plodding narrative that sputters to find an appropriate pace . two hours and twenty minutes is too long for this motion picture ; there are numerous scenes that could have found their way to the cutting room floor without sacrificing much of the story . the last half-hour has the electricity of any good thriller , except for one little problem : we already know the ending . carlito's way is not one of these . by knowing that carlito is going to be shot ( not to mention how it's going to happen ) , it drains away suspense from the big chase through grand central station . in fact , it's amazing that depalma manages to raise the finale to the level of excitement he achieves . presenting carlito's way in this curious fashion is apparently motivated by a desire to have al pacino narrate the story . this is a bad decision in more than one way , since the voice-overs are largely redundant , consisting of observations like \" i had a bad feeling about this \" or \" bad move , \" most of which the viewer can figure out on his or her own . coming off of his virtuoso performance in scent of a woman , one expects a lot from pacino , and he really doesn't deliver . his portrayal of carlito is competent , but not masterful . while it's helpful to remember that a below-par offering from pacino is often better than an outstanding job by many other actors , that doesn't prevent the viewer from comparing this to scarface , serpico , scent , and justice for all , and the godfathers . pacino fails to invest carlito with much energy , and there are times when the performance is flat . also , it becomes something of a challenge to identify pacino's constantly-shifting accent . sometimes it sounds puerto rican ( which it's supposed to be ) , but there are moments when it strays towards italian or is marked by a leftover southern strain from scent of a woman . perhaps the biggest surprise with respect to the cast is that pacino gets out-acted by sean penn , who hardly looks like himself with frizzy hair and nerdy glasses . penn plays an exceptionally annoying lawyer who spends most of his time snorting cocaine , and he does an excellent job in this low-key , but critical , role . for the most part , penelope ann miller is \" just there . \" her gail is perhaps too sweet to work in a strip joint and be the boyfriend of a gangster ; it isn't until one of her last scenes when we see a harder edge , and even then her performance verges on histrionics . gail's love is supposed to represent carlito's redemption , and the reason he thinks dreams are worth having , but i'm not sure the connection between them is strong enough for this to come across . david koepp's screenplay has some winning lines ( such as \" favor gonna kill you faster than a bullet \" ) , which isn't surprising considering the source material . technically , carlito's way is a combination of the innovative and the banal . the camerawork is invigorating , if sometimes a bit too exotic . depalma makes good use of the steadicam during the chase sequences , and this heightens whatever tension is present . the composer may do exceptional work for kenneth branagh , but his other movie music isn't particularly noteworthy . carlito's way probably should have been a taut thriller , but choices by depalma in both presentation and editing have hamstrung it . with the expectations for this film as high as they were , the impact should have been more forceful , and the focus better tuned .",

            "message": "where are the flying cows when you really need them ? dante's peak is obviously predicated on the dubious idea that bigger is better . 1996's twister brought in hundreds of millions at the box office by showcasing relatively small ( if something so destructive can be gauged as \" small \" ) natural disasters -- namely , tornadoes . the next logical step would be to go for something larger and more devastating . apparently , hurricanes weren't deemed visually impressive enough and earthquakes have been done to death , so hollywood has set its sights on volcanoes with not one , but two , similarly-themed disaster flicks . let's just hope volcano shows a glimmer more intelligence , not to mention a higher energy level , than dante's peak . no one is ever going to accuse twister of being a masterpiece of originality , but , as roller-coaster movie go , it's a great deal of fun . part of the reason is the effective use of audio and visual effects ; the other part is that director jan de bont knows how to get the adrenaline flowing . twister is a rush . dante's peak , on the other hand , is a bore . oh , it has its moments , but most of them are concentrated in the final forty-five minutes . the first hour , which is all typical disaster movie setup , is interminable . in keeping with time-tested formulas , we have a male/female pairing , children and animals in danger , a voice of reason that no one listens to until its too late , and a character with a tragedy in the past . the first hour of dante's peak is spent getting to know the characters . not that we need that much time , since they're all familiar types . if you manage to stay awake through fifty-five minutes of drivel , you'll be rewarded with some nifty special effects as the mountain throws everything it has at the town : fire , water , air , and earth . it's pretty impressive , i admit , but there's an unwelcome sense of deja vu . as recently as the aforementioned twister , we've already been there and done that , and it was a lot more enjoyable last time around . brosnan and hamilton gamely try to generate some chemistry , and , while both are appealing in their own right , the moronic plotline and dumb dialogue defeat them at nearly every turn . it will come as no surprise for astute viewers to learn that the screenwriter for dante's peak , leslie bohem , also wrote stallone's daylight . both movies feature some similarly embarrassing bad lines . meanwhile , director roger donaldson ( no way out , the getaway ) fails repeatedly to do anything interesting to enliven the proceedings . even discounting the first hour , dante's peak still isn't all that satisfying . i suppose there's a certain degree of tension as harry and company flee rivers of molten lava and volcanic shockwaves in their attempt to get out of town before it's buried in ash , but , with everything being done according to a well-established formula , the level of excitement stays low . once the film is over , you'll likely acknowledge that , although there's some nice eye candy , the experience as a whole leaves something to be desired . and there aren't even any flying cows to redeem the situation .",

            "message": "or , better yet , make that a whole box of tissues . the only dry eyes at the end of the film will belong to movie-goers who recognize writer/director lee david zlotoff's gauche and shameless manipulation . cynic that i am , i left the theater dry-eyed , realizing that , had zlotoff not been moved to inject overblown melodrama into this simple character-based piece , the spitfire grill could have been an enjoyable little picture . by failing to curb certain excesses , zlotoff damages the film's emotional balance . it's understandable why this motion picture took the audience award at this year's sundance film festival , especially when you consider the fete's growing commercial tendencies . with the spitfire grill , if you don't think too hard about what's going on , it's easy to be drawn in by the film's apparent sincerity . the movie pushes all the right buttons , and viewers inevitably react . however , the bottom line is that , while the spitfire grill is a tearjerker , it's too clumsily-constructed to be considered a skillful one . actually , the movie follows up a strong start with a solid middle . it's only in the last half-hour that things start to go bad . it's as if zlotoff , not knowing how to end the story , decided that the easiest way to tie up loose ends was to go for the quick , cheap way out . the concluding quarter of the spitfire grill contains a few too many contrivances -- missing money , a \" surprise \" revelation ( which is anything but unexpected ) , white water rafting without the raft , and an \" emotional \" speech that strikes the wrong chord . convinced that percy means no good , he'd like nothing better than to run her out of town . as a character study of percy , the spitfire grill works . elliot's performance keeps us involved for nearly the entire film , and almost gets us through the turbulence of the spitfire grill's dissatisfying climax . playing roles that are variations of familiar stereotypes , none of elliot's co-stars are especially noteworthy . burstyn's performance is robust , and harden is effectively pathetic ( despite the uneven accent ) , but patton's unsubtle , unsympathetic portrayal is unfortunate . there are numerous similarities between the spitfire grill and fried green tomatoes , but , while both movies shamelessly go for the tearducts , jon avnet's 1992 feature has a level of emotional honesty that's missing here . i wanted very much to like the spitfire grill , in large part because alison elliot made me care about percy , and , for the better part of ninety minutes , i was willing to forgive the movie its few , mostly small , narrative problems . unfortunately , those flaws multiply at an alarming rate as the end draws near , and i left the theater feeling somewhat let down . the spitfire grill isn't a bad movie , but , like percy's breakfast special , certain overdone portions are difficult to digest .",

            "message": "a number of words come to mind when considering walter hill's latest directorial effort , last man standing . a third is unnecessary . this exceptionally bloody film probably features more gunshots than all of bruce willis' die hard movies put together . the atmosphere is so thick and pointlessly \" artsy \" that it threatens to choke the viewer . and , since this story has already been filmed twice before , in much better versions ( akira kurosawa's 1961 yojimbo and sergio leone's 1964 a fistful of dollars ) , the audience is left wondering why hollywood felt the need to do it again . however , since that's exactly what a fistful of dollars did , the film makers felt compelled to add a prohibition-era flavor to the mix . the result is a bizarre mixture of western and gangster genres that doesn't really work . and , whatever other problems last man standing may exhibit , the lead actor's performance isn't among them . this pulls smith into jericho's unstable political situation . hill goes way overboard with atmosphere , incorporating elements of everything from traditional western and gangster motifs to film noir cliches . almost every outdoor scene features a dust storm and every indoor sequence is heavily shadowed . at times , the blowing dust bleeds out color , leaving us with shots that appear to be almost black-and- white . it's a clever conceit , but totally superfluous . atmosphere is supposed to be a background element , but hill forces it into the foreground , as if attempting to overcompensate for structural and plausibility problems in his script . then there's ry cooder's hard rock score , which seems vastly out of place for this sort of period piece . over-the-top , cartoonish violence is a big part of last man standing . hill is not sam peckinpah , however , and , as a result , much of the bloodshed comes across as gratuitous rather than stylized . sure , there are a lot of people we want to see killed , but this sort of wholesale carnage is more repetitious than satisfying . christopher walken is at his maniacal best as hickey , although , at this point in his career , i'm beginning to wonder if he can play anything other than a psycho . worse , the secondary characters are a poorly- developed lot , with motives that vary from incomprehensible to merely unexplained . as a shallow tale of conscienceless bloodshed and revenge , last man standing is reasonably effective . but as an updated version of the far better-realized yojimbo , it's an unqualified failure . last man standing is a surface picture -- it looks good , sounds good , and moves quickly -- but there's no depth whatsoever .",

            "message": "relying on the ruth prawer jhabvala's superficial and ill-focused script was probably his worst . surviving picasso is a passable film , but it's far from the kind of powerful motion pictures the producer/director team of merchant/ivory was turning out just a few years ago . merchant/ivory at their best means thought-provoking , emotionally wrenching drama that affects both heart and mind . howards end and the remains of the day are both amazing feats of film making -- deep , resonant studies of repression . surviving picasso isn't close to the same level . this shallow , almost-trite movie details picasso's interactions with one of his many mistresses without ever giving us a meaningful portrayal of any of the characters involved , including the painter and the woman . we go into a film like this expecting a full meal , but emerge never having gotten to the entree . there are moments when surviving picasso rises above the ongoing soap opera of francoise's attempts to make a life with her older lover -- brief discussions of painting , picasso's adept handling of art dealers , and an enjoyable interlude with henri matisse ( joss ackland ) . during these sequences , ivory's movie shines , but they represent a minority of the two-plus hour running time . of course , it can be argued that no film with anthony hopkins could be all bad . his picasso is nothing to be ashamed of : passionate , charismatic , and enigmatic . though he puts francoise through hell , he is never intentionally cruel , nor is he ever abusive or violent . picasso , as presented here , can often be short-tempered , insensitive , and neglectful , but he is never blatantly hurtful . hopkins displays all of the painter's faults while exhibiting a vulnerability that allows us to sympathize with him . newcomer natascha mcelhone , who plays francoise , has an attractive enough face and figure , but doesn't display great range . she's fine in most of the low-key scenes , but doesn't appear comfortable with displays of deep emotion . of the supporting performers , julianne moore stands out as the most memorable . her dora marr , a hardened , bitter woman , gives us a keen sense of the lasting damage picasso is capable of inflicting . even that would be okay if there was real depth and energy to their interactions , but , even given the acting talents of anthony hopkins , surviving picasso can't manage better than spotty character development . occasionally , francoise and picasso come across as real individuals , but rarely do they click as a couple . there's never any heat , even when francoise first disrobes in front of the painter ( in fact , considering hopkins' startled reaction , this scene is actually more funny than erotic ) . with ismail merchant producing , james ivory directing , and anthony hopkins starring in a film based on the life of one of the most colorful and influential artists of this century , a movie-goer is justified in expecting a film of epic scope . surviving picasso definitely doesn't fit the bill , and , as a result , represents the second straight disappointment to come from merchant/ivory .",

            "message": "8 heads in a duffel bag definitely isn't for everyone . but if you have a twisted sense of humor and can see the comedy in films like weekend at bernie's , this movie is right up your alley . for my part , while i wasn't overly impressed by significant chunks of the movie , there were times when i was nearly doubled over with laughter . 8 heads in a duffel bag works very much like a series of skits cobbled together into a movie -- some of them work , some don't . not surprisingly , the most interesting performer in the film is lead actor joe pesci . in the midst of all the madcap zaniness , pesci plays his role mostly straight -- a weary hitman who just wants to complete one last job so he can retire . some of 8 heads' best moments come as a result of pesci's even-handed approach to the material . in fact , the movie's comic momentum has a tendency to flag whenever he's off-screen for more than a few minutes . tommy's trouble starts on the airplane , when he's forced to check his bag because it's too large to be carried on . a lot of the humor in 8 heads is expectedly lowbrow and grotesque , but there are some truly inspired moments . writer/first-time director tom schulman ( who , curiously enough , penned dead poets' society ) clearly knows how to use macabre circumstances to get a laugh , although by the last reel he has become repetitive . while this is ultimately pesci's film , there is a fairly sizable supporting cast . newcomer andy comeau does a nice job making charlie seem both likable and inept . george hamilton , dyan cannon , and kristy swanson all have their moments , but , in general , their work here is largely forgettable . while louiso's interaction with the heads is worth at least a chuckle , spade is constantly more annoying than funny . 8 heads in a duffel bag offers humor of the most irreverent , and sometimes downright disgusting , sort . as a result , it belongs in the same group as films like the monster and cemetery man , neither of which could be described as examples of sophisticated taste . and , while this particular entry is not really a \" good \" film in the traditional sense , it's hard to make it all the way through without laughing your head off at least once .",

            "message": "apparently , it isn't enough for a plague to be the villain . the problem with outbreak is that extraneous plot elements like donald sutherland's general , a couple of aerial chases , and an unbelievably contrived search for a monkey , keep getting in the way of a chilling horror story . in this film , we're given tantalizing glimpses of that scenario , but the need to interject action and adventure for a momentary thrill robs outbreak of dramatic power . yes , this movie is an entertaining and sometimes wildly-exhilarating ride . the helicopter chase sequence is thrilling--only it doesn't seem to belong here . and , when the movie is over , any more-than-cursory consideration of the plot reveals gaps that even sizable doses of coincidence and contrivance can't completely fill . outbreak is not one of those pictures that improves in retrospect . but in 1995 , it shows up again , only this time it's not restricted to africa . as directed by accomplished film maker wolfgang petersen ( in the line of fire , das boot ) , outbreak is a beautifully photographed , competently-acted piece . dustin hoffman is carefully contained as daniels , never straying over the top . cuba gooding jr . gives a stable , if sometimes cliched performance , as the \" sidekick . \" freeman and russo are solid in supporting roles . only sutherland , sporting an american accent , can't avoid chewing on the scenery . his portrayal , like his character , would be more at home in dr . strangelove than here , and it's a sore spot that the movie never quite recovers from . most viewers are likely to enjoy outbreak , especially coming as it does in the midst of a veritable wasteland of general release pictures . it's an escapist thriller with good guys to root for and bad guys to hiss at . yet the source of lamentation is not what's on screen , but what could have been there . no one likes to be teased , but that's exactly what this movie does to us , with predictably frustrating results . fluff--especially the variety with a lot of flashes and bangs--often makes for perfect light entertainment , except when , as in the case of outbreak , it starts out with the promise of so much more . . . a promise that is never fulfilled on a higher-than-superficial level .",

            "message": "equal parts fantasy , satire , and pathos , ma vie en rose investigates the role of sexual stereotypes in today's culture , and shows how the more conservative elements of society encourage conformity and stifle diversity . in terms of both its style and story , this is one of 1997's few unique motion pictures ; it's understandable why it has captured a landslide of film festival awards . it's regarded as \" just part of growing up . \" the result -- a boy who adopts the traits of a girl -- is unacceptable . such a child , who plays with dolls , puts on makeup , and wears dresses , is likely to become a pariah . and that is the situation explored by alain berliner's debut feature , ma vie en rose . ludovic can't understand what the fuss is about . so why shouldn't he wear makeup and dresses , and play with dolls ? those who assume that he's gay have missed the point entirely -- sexuality isn't even an issue , at least not at this young age . one of berliner's successes is his ability to effectively realize multiple viewpoints . while ma vie en rose gets into ludovic's head and convincingly presents his confusion regarding the adults' negative reactions to his behavior , it also conveys the sense of near-panic that grips his parents . another standout aspect of the movie is its strong , vivid use of colors . nearly every hue of the spectrum is represented in pastels and fluorescents . in the end , it's apparent that the intense colors of ludovic's neighborhood do little to lighten the darkness that lurks in the hearts of many of the residents . to further emphasize their lack of human compassion , berliner paints many of ludovic's neighbors as caricatures , and occasionally has some fun at their expense . although the most memorable element of ma vie en rose is the forceful visual style , the director proves himself to be an apt student of human nature . the film works because we understand the central characters and their tribulations . when ludovic is teased and tormented , it's easy to remember how much unthinking cruelty there is in this world , whether the setting is paris or next door . but , when all is said and done , ma vie en rose is more of a fantasy than a straight drama , and berliner's lighthearted touch keeps the film buoyant when it could easily turn grim . - ingmar bergman",

            "message": "it's been more than fifteen years since the release of john carpenter's halloween , and ten since wes craven's a nightmare on elm street arrived on the big screen . each , in its own way , was a top-of- the-line horror flick--a film that relied more on chills and thrills than on graphic displays of butchery . those movies had unique visions of what was required to scare an audience , and neither resorted to the pointless and grotesque displays of gratuitous gore that permeated the other \" big \" entry of the time ( friday the 13th ) . but then came the inevitable sequels , and the corresponding plummet in quality . making a cheap buck took precedence over everything--including telling a good story . halloween 2 was steeped in blood . nightmare 2 , not directed by wes craven , lacked even a coherent story . by the end of the '80s , it was difficult to discern much difference between the various screen bogeymen : jason , michael , and freddy . it was still gore-happy , but its baddie , freddy , had a self-deprecating sense of humor ( his one-liners reminded one of the kinds of things that arnold schwarzenegger was wont to spout ) . by the fifth nightmare sequel , the films had become self- parodies . so why do another nightmare movie ? probably , as new line cinema exec robert shaye puts it ( in a cameo in this new entry ) , because the public wants it . the freddy krueger mask is still a pretty hot seller in halloween costume stores . perhaps the best turn of events is the return of wes craven , directing a nightmare for the first time since the original . he has returned a sense of genuine horror to the series , in part by taking it to completely new ground , and in part by giving his actors a legitimate script to work with . for his part , craven ( who also appears in the film ) is writing a new script ( which turns out to be the screenplay for this picture ) . those who can accept the basic premise are likely to have nearly as much fun . this isn't quite cinema verite , but at its most clever , it comes close--a sort of big-budget , horror version of my life's in turnaround . the only argument against craven's vision is that he perhaps didn't push the envelope far enough . the visual and gore effects , while not ilm top-of- the-line , are believable and occasionally downright chilling . the entire production is steeped in an unsettling atmosphere . the cinematic horror genre , like the science fiction one , has been badly hamstrung by poor films , and several of the nightmare on elm street entries have been at the forefront of the decline . therefore , it's somewhat ironic that one of the most intelligent and creative efforts to come along in a while bears the nightmare theme , title , and signature villain . any copycat features spawned by this movie will hopefully take a cue from wes craven's new nightmare and favor quality of scares over quantity of blood .",

            "message": "let me start by saying that hercules , walt disney pictures' 35th animated feature , makes for good family entertainment . good , not great . while this film is capable of providing a ninety minute diversion for both kids and adults , it's a far cry from such recent classics as the little mermaid , beauty and the beast , and aladdin . a mere five years ago , disney was developing top-notch animated movies on a regular basis . now , in 1997 , the studio's efforts have become dull and routine . no one is pushing disney and revenue is up -- where's the incentive to stop the assembly-line animated feature production and get back to creative movie making ? hercules has the dubious distinction of being the least-enchanting cartoon disney has fashioned in over a decade . many of these are understandable , given the studio's espousal of family values . so , instead , disney has made hercules the divine offspring of a couple that represents olympian marital bliss : zeus and hera . the majority of the film centers on the adult hercules performing all sorts of grueling tasks to clean up the ancient city of thebes ( \" the big olive \" -- if you can make it there , you can make it anywhere ) and establish his status as a hero . hercules comes close to being a remake of the the little mermaid with a male hero . one could easily argue that all disney animated films are similar ( for example , the hero is always a loner who proves herself/himself through some deed of self-sacrifice ) , but hercules is a little too blatant in its cannibalization of past themes and plot points . besides that , this film has a distractingly episodic feel . instead of coming together as a cohesive story , it's like a bunch of thinly-related events strung one-by-one to reach a ninety-minute running time . the most disappointing aspect of hercules is the amateurish quality of the artwork . in fact , this approach makes the film look rushed and , at times , incomplete . it is never a visual marvel -- even the computer-generated scenes fail to impress . the sequences intended to offer the biggest spectacle -- olympus and the underworld -- provoke little more than a yawn . with hercules , composer alan menken is scoring his sixth animated disney feature . however , the songs for last year's hunchback of notre dame were generic and lifeless , and there's little sign of improvement here . simply put , this is a boring soundtrack . on the other hand , hercules' vocal characterizations are uniformly good . joshua keaton and tate donovan team up effectively as the title character . rip torn makes for a nicely authoritative zeus . but the real star of the show is james woods , whose hades is the most vibrant disney creation since robin williams' genie . hades is a lively villain with a great repertoire of one-liners . and , although woods isn't as much of a vocal chameleon as williams , he's close enough that it hardly matters . hercules is saturated with cultural references -- points should be awarded for anyone who spots them all . most amusing of all , however , is the way hercules willingly lampoons its own reputation , taking several jabs at the inevitable merchandising whirlwind that surrounds its release . so , although hercules is undoubtedly one of the summer's most lightly enjoyable motion pictures , i couldn't shake the feeling that it could have been and done more . those on the lookout for another disney masterpiece won't uncover it here . however , anyone with the modest goal of finding a screen solution to the problem of a family outing need not worry : disney's 35th animated motion picture fills the prescription .",

            "message": "the film takes a lot of liberties with the original premise and characters , weaving a story that barely resembles the one which entertained tv audiences more than twenty years ago . oddly , even though the fugitive is an admitted chase movie , the scenes before the hunt begins are among the best of the movie . we don't see much of the relationship between richard and helen kimble , but what we're presented with gives us insight into the double tragedy faced by the doctor . well-photographed and directed with a flair , this part of the movie keeps viewers on the edges of their seats . most importantly , when on the run , kimble acts like an intelligent human being . equally as refreshing , the lawmen are his match , not a bunch of uniformed dunces being run around in circles . in fact , it could be argued that both kimble and gerard are too intelligent , not to mention too lucky . the plot is far from airtight , and there are a number of contrivances that come into play to bring about the resolution . how much of these you accept depends on how much license you're willing to give the film makers . considering the overall quality of the movie , i think they deserve some room to maneuver , and most of the plot hiccups didn't bother me . the movie's pace flags somewhat during the second hour as the pursuit cools down and kimble's own search for the one armed man takes up screen time . there's a little more talking and less action during the middle portion of the movie . of course , the action predictably starts to build again as the closing moments arrive . the ending lacks originality but is nevertheless more satisfying than not . there are too many leaps of intuition and handily placed clues . simplifying this part of the story might have resulted in a more tightly constructed plot , and a little less confusion about the motivation of some of the characters . personally , i wasn't that interested in kimble's search . these moments are at the heart of the movie ; they make the picture work because it's through them that suspense is developed . a little more of this kimble/gerard interplay might have put the fugitive squarely on the same level as another of the summer's big thrillers , in the line of fire . with all apologies to harrison ford , who turns in a far more emotive and less wooden performance than in patriot games , the real acting standout is tommy lee jones . he invests his character with charisma and energy and , as gerard's grudging respect for kimble grows , so does our appreciation of what jones is doing with his seemingly straightforward role . assuming that kimble is the good guy ( which the script goes out of its way to make clear ) , that means that gerard , who's chasing him , is the bad guy . while no one could accuse the fugitive of having a masterful insight into human nature , that's not why this film was produced . there's an odd moment or two when an element of someone's behavior strikes a responsive chord , but basically the characters are developed only enough to keep us interested in them as the chase proceeds . fans of the old tv series will find echoes of the show here , but most of this version is new . \" innovative \" is not a legitimate description of the fugitive , but \" entertaining \" is .",

            "message": "heavy on poorly-edited melodramatic sequences , they give little inkling of the level of emotional honesty attained . luis mandoki's film succeeds not because it tackles alcoholism , but because it faces up to the trauma that eats away at the lives of the non- alcoholics in the family . one failing of the script is that it assumes an unlikely level of ignorance from its audience . alcoholism is such a pervasive social problem that it's hard to accept that anyone likely to see when a man loves a woman wouldn't have a better understanding of the disease than the movie gives them credit for . but take a peek beneath the veneer , and there are problems . as potent as some of the scenes between michael and alice are , those featuring jess or casey invariably have greater impact . it helps that both young actresses are believable . meg ryan and andy garcia were probably given the lead roles more because of box office appeal than an ability to bring superior depth to their characters . surprisingly , while neither turns in an exceptional performance , they are both solid , and each has a few scenes in which they shine . the ending is too facile , and when a man loves a woman may take longer than necessary to arrive at its resolution . there are moments throughout when the script is apt to strike a raw nerve with some , as is often the case when a \" real \" issue is probed with any degree of sincerity . whatever else it may do , this film does not play it safe , and the risks it takes keep the audience engaged by the drama . this is not an original topic for a movie - especially one about alcoholism - but the script does a good enough job establishing the dynamics of the green family that we never doubt that the story deserves to be told . the film's poignancy is its strength , even as occasional didactic tendencies are its weakness . in balance , the former by far outweighs the latter , making this a worthwhile picture .",

            "message": "and , while there are significant differences between jan de bont's speed and andrei konchalovsky's 1985 thriller , runaway train , the films share two fundamental similarities : ferocious pacing and white- knuckle excitement . each picture features its own take on an unstoppable , high-velocity vehicle racing towards its doom . although speed is a very good movie , runaway train is a more complete experience . the script is better-written , depending more on visceral thrills than those enhanced by special effects ( that's not to say that runaway train is visually defective -- in fact , it's solid ) . the characters are better-rounded , and there is a fascinating exploration of man's primal instinct . runaway train belongs to a rare genre : the intelligent thriller . it will come as no surprise to educated movie-goers to learn that the script , credited to djordeje milicevic , paul zindel , and edward bunker , is based on an original screenplay devised by the japenese master , akira kurosawa . one can almost imagine kurosawa regular toshiro mifune in the role given to jon voight . runaway train uses a mix of diverse elements to create a highly- suspenseful whole . we see a microcosm of humanity at its most base and noble through them , as their desperate circumstances drive them to acts of terrible brutality and surprising heroism . runaway train closes with an apt quote from shakespeare's \" richard iii \" that reinforces another of the film's themes about the animalistic nature of human beings : \" no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity . but i know none , and therefore am no beast . \" the most electric scene of the film takes place around the three- quarters mark , and reveals key , primal aspects of each individual's personality . \" i thought you was my friend ! don't make me kill you , manny ! \" shouts buck . it's a raw moment that not only keeps us on the edge of our seat , but gives us real insight into how these characters react in such dire circumstances . the three lead actors all give strong performances , and are ably assisted by a solid supporting cast . jon voight captivates in one of the most memorable screen roles of his distinguished career , imbuing manny with both a fierce energy and a surprisingly keen intellect . this is definitely not a common , stereotypical criminal . when runaway train was produced , the action genre was undergoing a change from character-driven movies to pyrotechnics-based flicks . of the thrillers developed after this one , only a select few -- die hard and perhaps one or two others -- have achieved this level of tautness without compromising the intelligence of the plot . it is just as compelling today as it was during the winter of 1985-86 . - ingmar bergman",

            "message": "every movie has its own \" making of \" story , but , no matter how fascinating the account , it's unusual for the unexpurgated truth to emerge into the public realm . 1995's twelve monkeys is a rare exception . perhaps the first question that leaps to mind is : why call it the hamster factor ? the story goes something like this : there's a scene in twelve monkeys where a naked bruce willis is required to draw a sample of his own blood . the take went as expected , except the hamster didn't do anything . so there was a re-shoot , and the same thing happened . gilliam continued to re-film this sequence until the rodent did what it was supposed to . in the director's own words , however , this is \" a bit of detail that probably doesn't mean anything to anyone but myself . \" because this incident exemplifies gilliam's obsessive approach to film making , the hamster factor stuck . for twelve monkeys admirers and destractors alike , this represents an intriguing , intimate look at what went right and wrong on and around the set . even those who haven't seen gilliam's movie will be intrigued by much of what transpires . the hamster factor has a different agenda than most \" making of \" movies -- this isn't intended as a glorified advertisement for twelve monkeys ; it's more along the lines of eleanor coppola's hearts of darkness , which details the behind-the-scenes trials and tribulations of apocalypse now . in it , gilliam made some uncomplimentary comments about his leading man's acting style . ) undeniably , the most interesting aspect of the hamster factor is watching gilliam's creative crisis . willis at times proves to be a headache ( contrast his \" hands-on \" approach with the quiet , introverted style of madeleine stowe ) , and the $29 million budget restricts the film maker's vision . as filming progresses , he becomes obsessed by visual imagery and details -- so much so that midway through , he confesses that he has \" lost the film totally \" . the hamster factor is so absorbed with gilliam that it doesn't spend much time on technical behind-the-scenes details . there is some - - the editing process is described , for example -- but , most of the traditional \" making of \" documentary elements are missing . another thing that comes across is that , while willis occasionally clashes with gilliam , the actor's passion is obvious , and it wouldn't be a surprise to see him behind the cameras soon . the hamster factor , which distilled 135 hours of footage into a 90- minute movie , follows twelve monkeys all the way to its release . given gilliam's occasional bouts of depression and disgust for his craft , it will be interesting to see what his next project will be , if there is one . in europe , it will receive a similar treatment , being appended to the laserdiscs and home videos of its parent film , or receiving a television broadcast . so , while the hamster factor will not be showing at the local multiplex , it's not destined for obscurity , and , when it becomes available , it's worth seeking out . -- ingmar bergman",

            "message": "every time i think hollywood has slipped beyond redemption , someone in the system produces a film like jerry maguire that renews my faith . apparently , creativity is not dead in the mainstream movie market -- not entirely , at least . this is the kind of movie that reminds me why i started reviewing in the first place . jerry maguire is magic on celluloid -- fresh , funny , romantic , and upbeat . you'll leave the theater with a smile on your face and perhaps a tear in your eye . here , however , the actor is playing to his strength , which lies in an arena that demands less testosterone . leave the stunts and explosions to schwarzenegger and stallone . cruise is best when he stays low key and flashes the occasional smile . and , in this picture , surrounded by a superlative supporting cast , his ability shines . jerry maguire works because we root for the title character , and it's cruise's performance that forges the link between his screen personae and the audience . the essay attacks the sports agency business , advocating a more humane approach . in an era of downsizing and force reductions , it's easy to understand what happens to jerry . it's about finding one's heart and soul in a business climate that attempts to rip both away . writer/director cameron crowe , who previously helmed say anything and singles ( in addition to scripting fast times at ridgemont high ) brings both a strong sense of verisimilitude and a lively wit to his film . even as jerry maguire reaches out to the heart , it tickles the funny bone . not only does crowe have a knack for creating multi- dimensional personalities for secondary characters with minimal screen time , but he uses traditional formulas in unique ways to serve his themes . for example , a common sports cliche is integrated into jerry maguire in such a way that it doesn't seem cheap or overdone . it's not the point of the movie ; it's just another piece in the overall puzzle . with a fine performance , he forms the glue that holds the production together . cuba gooding jr . , who was excellent years ago in his boyz 'n the hood debut , but hasn't done much since , invests rod with a remarkable level of energy and enthusiasm . and , although his favorite phrase is \" show me the money ! \" , with a standout performance , she transforms what could have been an minor role into something noteworthy . zellweger displays an appealing blend of strength and vulnerability , and her chemistry with cruise is nearly perfect . their first romantic scene is charged with a playful , but undeniable , eroticism . if there's one downside to the actress' appearance in jerry maguire , it's that she's not on screen enough . and , even if jerry isn't immediately smitten , we are . while the budding romance between jerry and dorothy is jerry maguire's most enchanting element , the remainder of the film has the necessary appeal to keep our attention when zellweger isn't around ( cruise , on the other hand , is in just about every scene ) . crowe , who doesn't have a subpar entry on his short resume , has crafted another winner here . in fact , with its attention to detail , top-notch performances , and universal themes , jerry maguire marks his most successful movie to date . for anyone who has forgotten the feelings that a wonderful movie can trigger , jerry maguire provides a welcome reminder .",

            "message": "\" and to all the critics who hated our last flick -- all is forgiven . \" -- chasing amy's closing credits well , i didn't exactly hate mallrats , but i thought it was a comedown for kevin smith , the talented writer/director who debuted strongly with 1994's clerks . chasing amy fits in nicely with the director's previous two films . as in clerks and mallrats , there are numerous references to pop culture ( the ubiquitous star wars films , comic books , the archie comic strip , tv shows alice and star trek , and even a few in-jokes related to clerks ) . smith's brand of bawdy humor is also very much in evidence , although it should be noted that chasing amy isn't as hilarious as clerks . in fact , it could be argued that this film isn't even as funny as mallrats . instead , chasing amy finds other ways to satisfy its audience , and the result is the most complete and mature film of smith's short career . with chasing amy , it's easy to anticipate a certain degree of inventive humor , but what's a bit unexpected is the solid drama , effective romance , and strong characters . clerks worked because the dialogue sparkled , but smith has honed his screenwriting and film making skills since then . while chasing amy boasts the same keen interplay , that quality , along with first-rate character development , acts as a supplement to the smart , surprisingly original plot . the movie starts out as light as a feather , but it doesn't take long for us to realize that chasing amy isn't just another lark for smith . this movie is about something , and the deeper we get into it , the more we realize how emotionally on-target the script is . alyssa's project is the less testosterone-oriented idiosyncratic routine . but , whether or not it's really love , holden is in for a big surprise because alyssa is a lesbian . his observations about comic books , video games , and other aspects of life in the '90s are as insightful as they often are scathing . but this is nothing new -- it was evident in both clerks and mallrats . what's different here is that smith has crafted a touching , nuanced romance which may be the most memorable screen love affair since before sunrise . there are real human feelings and problems involved in holden and alyssa's relationship , and , every time the storyline threatens to devolve into a cliche , it somehow avoids the trap . there's also a rich subtext pertaining to the difficulty that many individuals face in attaining a level of comfort with their sexual identity . the best scenes are those that explore the evolving relationship between holden and alyssa . ben affleck and joey lauren adams , both veterans of smith films , develop an effective chemistry . adams , who looks a little like cameron diaz and sounds a little like jennifer tilley , displays surprising dramatic range and ability . like clerks , chasing amy doesn't shy away from profane conversations . there's even an instance when oral sex is compared to ( of all things ) the weather channel and cnn ( you'll have to see the movie to understand why ) . in fact , i can't print any of chasing amy's best lines here -- they're all r-rated . chasing amy is entertainment of the best sort . for nearly two hours , it keeps the audience enraptured . there aren't many missteps , and , those few that exist are minor and easily forgiven . chasing amy is touching , funny , sweet , and most important of all , real -- a welcome breath of fresh air . you can't ask for more than that from any motion picture , and you'll be hard-pressed to find a movie in theaters these days that offers anything more appealing , revealing , or enjoyable than kevin smith's third feature .",

            "message": "perceptive is the best single word i can come up with to describe the ice storm , ang lee's near-masterpiece that deconstructs the american family . for , although the film is provocative , entertaining , and impeccably crafted , its greatest strength is its ability to convey truths that lie deep beneath the surface . the ice storm is perceptive about people , relationships , and human nature , and there's not a single moment in the entire 112 minute running length that rings false . then , in 1994 , lee was selected to helm emma thompson's adaptation of jane austen's sense and sensibility . the film , which was released in 1995 , earned multiple academy award nominations and ensured that lee would never again be relegated to obscurity . for his followup to sense , lee chose the ice storm , and the accomplished result points to a director who has matured in every way . the hood family , like so many others of the time , is dysfunctional , even though it doesn't appear to be . it's a coming of age tale that shows how the discoveries and development of the parents parallel those of their children , and suggests that age doesn't always equate to understanding . sexually and socially , everyone in this film is groping for answers , whether their age is fourteen or forty . in fact , it could be argued that the teenagers have a clearer and healthier approach to sexuality than their elders . more often than not , the children in the ice storm are open about what they want . the adults , on the other hand , feel the need to resort to deception and wife-swapping games to achieve the same ends . not only is the storm crucial to the film's resolution , but its vivid presentation makes it almost a character in its own right as it coats trees , power lines , and streets with ice and turns the world into a beautiful-but-deadly place . ( from a technical standpoint , it's amazing to note that lee created the winter wonderland without any help from mother nature -- as credible as everything looks , none of the ice is real . ) every character in this film is interesting , and it's a pleasure to spend time with each of them . no one here is perfect , and we're presented with finely-detailed portraits of flesh-and-blood human beings , with their strengths and weaknesses laid bare . it's amazing how real these characters are , and how profoundly engrossing such a simple story can be . however , for those of us who lived through that era , there are plenty of familiar images and items . some , like the bellbottoms , wide-collared shirts , and gas- guzzling cars , are expected . others , like the bubble umbrella and the anti-pollution tv spot featuring a crying native american , show that lee was willing to take things to another level of detail . while it's true that the ice storm may not represent the reality of the '70s , it effectively fits our memories of the time . the lead performances are all terrific . kevin kline elicits feelings of sympathy and scorn for the loutish ben . tobey maguire is believable as the kind of guy that girls always see as the brotherly type . as expected , ricci doesn't let us down -- her interpretation of wendy is knowing , intense , and nuanced . i have heard complaints that the trailer for the ice storm makes the film look uninvolving . if that's true , it does this fine motion picture a great disservice . then again , it's always difficult to effectively represent a drama using two minutes of clips . the ice storm's impact cannot be conveyed in such a short span -- this is a movie that needs to be seen in its entirety . the experience will be more than worth the investment in time . the ice storm is at times funny , poignant , moving , and sensitive -- but , no matter what , it's always perceptive . \" the cinema is not an art which films life : the cinema is something between art and life . unlike painting and literature , the cinema both gives to life and takes from it . . . \" - jean-luc godard",

( has anyone ever thought that the future might be better ? ) with so few science fiction movies being made every year , paul anderson's bad ones are in danger of polluting the market for other would be science fiction filmmakers . the movie contains realistic scenes of 8-year-old boys beating each other to a pulp as the blood spurts from their battered bodies . ( the adults treat each other worse in one of the goriest films of the year . director anderson has no concept of subtlety . think there might be a rematch ? you are way ahead of the story . actually you could easily complete the predictable screenplay . todd , acting like a robot , has two modes -- staring and fighting . in the first , his brain seems to be in an idle loop . todd spends a lot of time getting beaten-up and generally abused , but he manages to keep on going . in our audience , one of the few big laughs came from some young kids , who were inappropriately at an r rated movie with their father . ah , too bad writer david webb peoples couldn't have come up with some funny lines like that to insert into the leaden script . only gary busey , as the head of the old soldiers , gets any decent lines . \" you must feel something ? \" although todd , in one of the few times he speaks during the movie , comes up with a reply , the real answer is that he doesn't feel , not in any normal sense . if soldier had been rewritten as a parody , it might have had some hope . or , if the lead had been given some complexity and a touch of humanity , that might have helped . what we are offered instead is a movie in which we have to watch soldiers who kill men , women , and children with no more compassion than we'd reserve for an ordinary housefly . if the story had something to say , we might forgive its needless gore , but it doesn't . soldier has the depth of a television-wrestling match , but without the comedy . it is rated r for strong violence and profanity and would be acceptable for older teenagers .",

            "message": "it's the movie that everyone feared , incorrectly as it turned out , that titanic would be -- a big , expensive special effects extravaganza without a heart . and it's the kind of movie that leaves viewers angry for wasting incredible amounts of their time with such drivel . you'll laugh . you'll cry . you'll undoubtedly laugh out loud at its many sappy moments of ridiculous hokum . and you probably at least feel like crying that such an important event in our country's history has been turned into a silly romance with one clich ? d line after another . what a colossal wasted opportunity . buy the popcorn and go for the big tub . you'll need something to do as you wait forever for the movie to get to its raison d' ? tre , the destruction of most of the united states's navy at pearl harbor . all of the characters are reduced to stereotypes so that you'll likely care little when tragedy strikes them . even the movie's sex scene , which is shot with a soap commercial gloss , is laughable . sometimes the film gets so over-the-top that you begin to wonder if it is an intentional parody of a wartime romance . the trite dialog includes such gems as , \" you don't dogfight with a manual , \" \" if i had one more night to live , i'd want to spend it with you , \" \" all i ever wanted was to have a home and grow old together , \" and \" good huntin' . \" after most such lines , the music is brought up dramatically . the movie , with its heavy , syrupy score , frequently seems more like a music video than a movie . the trailer scenes form the body of the movie's only successful part , the half-hour section that occurs just past the midpoint in this endurance contest of a picture -- it's over three hours long . my advice to you is to arrive ninety minutes late since nothing , absolutely nothing , of interest happens until the japanese zeros arrive to obliterate our fleet . what , you will be asking yourself frequently during this period , does this all have to do with pearl harbor ? and , as you twiddle your thumbs waiting for something to happen , you'll keep asking yourself , \" why does this story have to be over three hours long ? \" which brings us to the movie's most intriguing revelation . in a fascinating bit of revisionist history , the movie has the japanese leader explain how they were forced into it . kind of makes you wonder what insights a bruckheimer story about hitler would divulge about his real motives . if you're willing to put up with the saccharine nonsense of the first half , the movie's middle section -- a cgi tour de force -- will send chills up your spine as our boys are almost completely annihilated and sent to watery graves in which many still lie . the computer generated effects are awesome , which is a good argument for seeing a film about the making of pearl harbor . \" i'm not going to make it , \" one of the brave soldiers says at the end . i know just how he feels . i barely made it through the long ordeal of watching the movie . it is rated pg-13 for sustained intense war sequences , images of the wounded , brief sensuality and some language and would be acceptable for teenagers . its pg-13 rating is quite questionable since the horrific scenes of the wartime wounded , who squirt blood everywhere , are much more intense than you'd ever expect to find in a pg-13 film . in the silicon valley , it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters . just send me a letter with the word \" subscribe \" in the subject line .",

            "message": "it is an iranian film about the preparations for the coming persian new year . the movie is told in almost real time and starts one and a half hours before the beginning of the new year when the people in teheran are in a frenzy making sure that everything is ready . excitement is in the air . it was at this point in the show that my guilt began . how could i not be liking a show that was trying so hard ? clearly director jafar panahi was doing his best to craft a sweet little slice of life piece , and here he had gotten himself a girl that has no screen presence and more over was about as much fun to listen to as someone scraping their fingers down a blackboard . playing a role of the little girl that everyone wished would go away , she could do , but here so was supposed to be the charming lead character . aida mohammadkhani plays razieh as a very unsympathetic character . oh well , i though , the mother is sweet and the brother is not too bad , perhaps the only flaw , albeit a large one , will be the miscast lead . soon i was to find another aspect of the story as infuriating as aida mohammadkhani's performance , namely the show's sound by said ahmadl and mojtaba mortazavi . rarely is it that the sound becomes a big detraction , but it is in the white balloon . striving for authenticity , i guess , the director has background sounds frequently drowning out the actors . now , loud music is one thing , but the audience has to endure a cacophony of obnoxious traffic noises , radio talk shows blasting out from hidden boom boxes , and most irritatingly of all , off screen people , especially the unseen older brother inside the house , yelling at other people . it made me want to escape the theater and go sit in some peaceful spot to give my ears a rest . not a pleasant time . the script by abbas kiarostami is minimalist and is need of a rewrite . we are left with a story that works or doesn't solely based on the intrinsic charm of the lead character . so what is good about the show ? mohsen kafili and fereshteh sadr orfani deliver nice performances . the music , when it is there , is quite pleasant . most of all , i give the producer ( kurosh mazkouri ) a lot of credit for attempting such a sweet little tale . it is too bad the execution is so flawed . as a critic , there is nothing worse than having to give a thumbs down to something that you want desperately to like , but can not . it is oh so much easier to err on the side of grade inflation . giving movies thumbs down has the potential for generating a plethora of complaining letters ranging from polite disagreements to diatribes . if you overpraise a movie , all you get is silence . when i confessed that i did not like forest gump , burnt by the sun , and the birdcage , i got a wide range of letters , but most people claimed it proved how stupid i was not to have liked the movie since they and the rest of known world liked it , end of argument . as somerset maugham said , \" people ask you for criticism , but they only want praise . \" the white balloon runs 1 : 25 , but feels a lot longer . it is in farsi with english subtitles . it has no mpaa rating , but would probably be g . the show would be fine for kids of all ages , but i suspect most will be as bored with it as i was . i can not recommend this attempt at a sweet little tale , but i give the film * 1/2 for trying hard and for a couple of decent performances by the mother and the younger brother . actually , i fear that i getting too softhearted , and * 1/2 may be too generous . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

            "message": "heat is a action movie of great energy and excellent stunts that masquerades as an epic . the plot can easily be summarized as cat chases mouse , mouse chases cat , and cat and mouse stop to share a cup of coffee . it is an intriguing , but exhausting movie where only two aspects ( bad guys and the stunts ) of the movie work . it is an interesting movie with lots of action so most viewers will leave the theater satisfied and yet it has the potential for much more that it delivers . the action sequence here is impressive and the best part is the sound effects - massive steel on steel impact . shades of the die hard series . detective hanna says , \" i've got a lot of angst . i preserve it , i hold it , it keeps me sharp where i've got to me . \" you do what you do best and try to catch bad guys like me . \" several times during the show mccauley reminds us of his guiding principle , \" do not get attached to anything you can not walk out on in thirty seconds flat if the heat comes around the corner . \" shakespeare this isn't . the movie has many an exhilarating action scene full of great sound effects especially of assault-weapons . sorry to say that since mann believes he is creating something on the scale of the godfather sagas , he pads the movie with numerous and superfluous family scenes . none of them work . the only point the families seem to serve is to say that both good guys and bad guys have families to distract them and that the families on both sides look and act alike . justine complains to her husband that \" i may be stoned on grass and prozac , but you've been walking through my life dead . \" the robbers are quite well done . the makeup and the costumes add to their aura of evil . the acting by the robbers is excellent . de niro delivers a strong but controlled performance as do kilmer and voight . pacino , on the other hand , loses control emotionally in almost every scene . the script attempts to compensate by giving him a plethora of expletives for adjectives with which to scare the crooks . now we come to believability . this is where the movie earns its lowest scores . let's take a quiz . if someone is firing a stream of bullets from an assault-weapon into your windshield , would drive keep driving straight into him ? if you are surrounded by hundreds of policemen and you have to fired constantly for many minutes , would you never need to reload ? in this case , would you expect to kill scores of police but get away unscathed yourself ? if you are a cop , would you push a guy through a plate glass window to make him talk ? the music is bland - made up mostly of pseudo-haunting violin melodies . the camera work is good and fast paced in the action sequences , but it has too many hyper close-ups in the family scenes . when pacino's nose covers the entire screen at the local monsterplex , you feel like you are viewing mount rushmore . heat runs ( sometime crawls ) 2 : 51 , but there is really only enough material for two hours . it is correctly rated r as it is full of violence with more deaths that you can hope to count . i do not remember any nudity , but there was a little sex . it is suitable only for mature teenagers . i liked all of the bad guys and the stunts are terrific , but ultimately i have to give the movie a mild thumbs down . it gets * * from me . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : december 21 , 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

( the film does not discriminate . unger is perfectly cast in the role . her vacant eyes had me convinced that she was dead more than once during the film . second would be bodily disfiguration caused by crashes . the car crashes and the sex scenes are quite graphic and realistic . cronenberg delights in gratuitous violence . and yet , the filmmaking is intriguing despite its repugnant aspects . still , if you or a close friend has ever been hurt in a car crash , i would avoid this film like the plague since it will undoubtedly rekindle bad memories . those of us fortunate enough not to be in that position can perhaps look upon the film a bit more dispassionately . i am not making this up as dave barry would say . ) just when you think you've met the weirdest group of characters imaginable , stranger people still come on the scene . vaughan is something of a philosopher . looking like super bowl sunday , these viewers are glued to the screen , watching tapes of car crashes even if the narration is in german . the cinematography by peter suschitzky is alternatively beautiful and gory -- blending shadows , headlights , chrome , sex , and gashing wounds . the sets by carol spier are gritty and almost clinically realistic . the oppressive music by howard shore bristles with tension from the twangy guitar strings . when the half dozen critics left the press screening , each of us found ourselves saying to the other , \" drive carefully . \" it is rated nc-17 for graphic violence , accident carnage , full frontal nudity , explicit and aberrant sexual content , drug usage , and the list goes on . this show is not appropriate for kids of any age . as a thriller and a piece of filmmaking , crash is quite impressive , but i could never bring myself to recommend this exploitive film . i give it * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs . trekker polemic as not worth arguing about . ) the good-spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable , loud giggles , yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe . in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary ( oed ) . unless you've been to the conventions , i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans . one pointed out , apologetically , that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate . others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended , several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of . arguably the most famous of all the trekkies , she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die-hard fans do . she doesn't quite understand all of the uproar . along with the laugher the show evokes , there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty . and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment . few other avocations could give this much satisfaction . ( for the record , i'm not a star trek fan although i have seen some of the movies . ) the film interviews the various star trek series's stars as well as its fans . at one , the actor who plays q was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel . with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity . not just flitting among people , the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies . the movie bogs down only briefly when it tries to argue the series's larger meaning about diversity and humanitarian concerns . sandwiched in-between the levity , the switch in tone doesn't work . he fits right in . trekkies runs a breezy 1 : 26 . it is not rated but would be pg for brief sexual references and would be fine for all ages .",

( neither , however , is better than the animated original . ) glenn close , having a ball chewing up the scenery , is terrific , but it's the dogs that make the show . the best dog of the bunch has to be the eminently lovable oddball . this lack of dots gives oddball lots of opportunities to get into trouble trying to acquire them . the spilled ink from a photocopier's toner cartridge is just one such source of black splotches . oddball is mr . mischief and the dog most likely to appear in the dog endangerment scenes that make the film's g rating a bit questionable . ( there were several blood curdling screams from little tykes in our audience when it looked like oddball was going to be a goner . ) an unusual dog , he has colorful feathers and a beak , although he doesn't think he can fly . giving a single animal the ability of speech makes the story funny without being too silly . sometimes the simplest scenes of the dogs wagging their tails are so cute that you can't help but break into a big smile . and the sets and the costumes alone can provoke quite a few laughs . depardieu doesn't have much of a part , but he makes the most of it . always pronouncing puppies as \" poopies , \" he sounds like he just walked off the rugrats set . 102 dalmatians is first and foremost a movie ripe with physical comedy . the dialog is treated as almost an afterthought . so what video would a bunch of dogs want to watch when their master is on a date ? in one of the story's best sequences , the movie cuts between the video and kevin and chloe enjoying spaghetti just like lady and the tramp . on the whole , however , 102 dalmatians is a good spirited movie that rarely disappoints . it is rated g , but the \" poopie \" endangerment scenes may scare some kids under 5 . my son jeffrey , age 11 , gave the film * * * . he really liked oddball and waddlesworth , but complained that he missed the dogs from the first movie . maxim , age 12 , went wild over the picture and gave it * * * * . nickolas , age 11 , gave it * * * 1/2 , having similar comments to jeffrey's . eliot , age 11 , on the other hand , hated the movie , giving it just * 1/2 . he complained that it wasn't original and that it didn't link properly to the first film . the votes from the rest of jeffrey's 6th grade class were quite positive although there were a few who didn't like it .",

            "message": "thirteen days , starring and produced by kevin costner , depicts this famous period . as a history lesson , it is absolutely engrossing , but , as a movie , it falls short of what it should have been able to achieve . although the film is well worth seeing and clearly gets a hit , with this material it should have gotten a home run . directed by roger donaldson , whose dubious credentials include his most recent films , dante's peak and species , and scripted by david self , whose only credit is the laughably bad the haunting , thirteen days is perhaps as good as could be expected . greenwood's bland performance is emblematic of what is wrong with the movie , namely that it gets itself bogged down in long , slowly paced interior scenes in which the strategy is planned . but when the movie cuts back and forth between the politics on the ground and the excitement of the ships at sea and the planes in the air , the film really comes alive . pointed at the united states , these missiles could reach almost as far as seattle and could kill most american citizens within minutes . it is only partially successful . trevor jones's music for the picture is the old-fashioned melodramatic type . but the acting is generally too reserved . when the director allows emotions to come to the surface , the movie has the impact that it should . thirteen days is definitely a movie with an explicit message . besides the fantastic history lesson , the movie leaves us to ponder the veracity of its anti-military message and to wonder how much revisionist history is taking place . it is rated pg-13 for brief strong language and would be acceptable for any kid old enough to be interested in this period in history .",

( remember , you're sworn to secrecy . ) the russian turns out to be none other than world-renowned russian ballerina rudolph petrov ( ryan phillippe ) , who tells allen , \" i wish to defecate -- i mean defect . \" about to go stark raving mad , fry tells him , \" i've only said one sentence since you arrived , and you've been correcting it ever since . \" indicative of the wild level of the comedy is the casting of woody allen as the cia station chief . the producers managed to find a cryogenically frozen woody from his wonderfully crazy , early comedies like bananas and defrost him . i half expected tom cruise to pop by the set for a cameo . the writers use variations on them in the script . it is rated pg-13 for brief sexual humor and drug content , but it is so mild that it's basically pg . with the exception of one ribald scene during the ending credits , the film would be acceptable for almost all kids , but kids probably need to be 11 or 12 to be able to appreciate the film's humor . just send me a letter with the word \" subscribe \" in the subject line .",

            "message": "after the wildly popular but cheesy the lost world : jurassic park , moviegoers have been wondering whether jurassic park iii , this time directed by joe johnston ( october sky and jumanji ) , would follow the usual movie rule whereby each sequel is another drop in quality from its predecessor . well , i'm here to report that jurassic park iii is a rule breaker , a smartly written and funny popcorn flick that is a lot of fun . it isn't as needlessly gory as lost world , so it should appeal to younger ages , and the screenwriters , first-timer peter buchman and the citizen ruth and election team of alexander payne and jim taylor , pack plenty of goodies for older viewers as well . and the monsters , i mean dinosaurs , are more realistic than ever , including some new flying dinosaurs . the corollary is guessing who will survive to the end , which is typically easy since you are usually safe figuring out the salary of the stars and then reasoning that the studios will want to get the most bang for their buck . this means that eluding them proves extra tricky . the script lets the humans find just enough tools of various kinds to make it . ingenuity is at a premium and the survivors evidence both courage and brains . the best part of the movie may be the length . just when you are completely satisfied and before you ever have a chance to get tired and start checking your watch , the movie concludes quickly and efficiently . and it ends without any doubt as to whether the studio wants to call an end to the jurassic park franchise . it is rated pg-13 for intense sci-fi terror and violence and would be acceptable for kids around 8 and up , depending on how well they handle monster violence . my son jeffrey , age 12 , gave it * * * * . he said it was much better and not as blood thirsty as lost world . he thought the plot was cool and the graphics were great . he liked the way it related back to the original in story , style and music . in the silicon valley , it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters . just send me a letter with the word \" subscribe \" in the subject line .",

            "message": "always imaginative director apted has given us a wide varied of wonderful films . his documentary series 21up , 28up , and 35up are among my all time favorite films and a must see for any cinema buff . as he showed in gorky park and does again here in extreme measures , he is also a master at the thriller genre . thrillers have good guys and bad . as hitchcock taught us , the best thrillers focus on the innocent man in the center . finally , through shear perseverance he somehow manages to thwart the villain . the patient's heart and all of his bodily functions race wildly and then calm like passing through the eye of a hurricane . this scene happens early in the show and serves not only to set up the plot , but also to get the audience's adrenaline pumping wildly in sync with the dying man . apted's craftsmanship shines . confused at what is going on and what , if any role , the coroner has in it , dr . luthan tells him , \" you're quite a creepy person . \" grant gives a sympathetic and convincing performance as the everyday doctor who gets sucked into the vortex of some gruesome terror and has no idea what is going . it is created in such a way that the audience is in total empathy with the lead character . i can't tell you any more of the show other than to say that every time you think you have it all figured out , you haven't . although the medical conspiracy and most of the rest of the show is made believable , there is a homeless syndicate that isn't . finally , there is an unnecessary and confusing epilogue . why it is there , i have no idea other than perhaps it is a failed attempt to address some criticisms made during the test screenings . it is rated r for violence , emergency room gore , some bad language , and brief nudity . there is no sex . teenagers will probably like the show , but it would be inappropriate for younger kids . i recommend the picture to you and give it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

            "message": "bound is a classic film noir . it is made even more so with at once both innovative and nostalgic cinematography by bill pope . although it is a color film , his color palette consists of exactly five colors - black , white , gray , flesh tones , and red for blood . actually , there is a smattering of a sixth color , green , but that is it . if you have to see blues , purples , or yellows in your pictures , don't bother to see this film ; they aren't there . if you want to know more about the process behind this , last sunday's ( october 6 , 1996 ) new york times's arts and leisure section had a long and fascinating article about the cinematic process behind this film . the answer , so that i do not get a thousand letters asking me , is \" what is white to you . \" it seems there are innumerable gradations of white , and the colors of the sets revolve that fundamental choice . the wachowskis both the directed the film and wrote the script . although some of the strong imagery and shock value is the same , the wachowski are just not in the same league as the coens . the only other movie credit the wachowskis have is that they wrote the script for the formulaic action thriller assassins for sylvester stallone . all of this notwithstanding , bound is a good show with more twists and turns that you can count . if you can guess them all , go to the head of the class , i certainly couldn't , and for that reason i am going to tell you very little about the story itself . to make their film noir fresh and different , the wachowskis have the leads be a pair of lesbian lovers . she is tough as nails , has lots of tattoos , and is usually very greasy from her work unclogging drains . the other , violet ( jennifer tilly ) , looks sweet and harmless , but isn't . the plot is an elaborate double cross labyrinth . editor zach staenberg cuts the scenes fast enough to maintain the high energy , but not so quick as to confuse the audience with the time frames . the strong and dramatic music by don davis has the horns blasting to keep up the tension . subtle it is not . the sound effects editing is equally heavy . the acting is all good . although he only got third billing , i was particularly fond of joe pantoliano's realistic bumbling . it is rated r for sex , nudity , violence , gore , and bad language . this is a film for adults and quite mature teenagers not easily sickened when someone's fingers are being cut off . i had a great time watching the plot's twists and turns so i recommend this movie although granted it is not for everyone , and i award it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : october 8 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

            "message": "this nameless dog -- judd only gives his dogs numbers -- has been christened shiloh by marty , and the animal has won marty's heart . first-time writer and director dale rosenbloom's film shiloh garnered rave reviews when it was released earlier this year . as a film critic , i understand the marketing of non-family films -- i can't say adult films since the pornography industry has absconded with that moniker -- but the marketing and distribution of family films continues to baffle me . with mediocre products such as that darn cat , a simple wish and gone fishin' getting a wide distribution , why couldn't they have promoted an intelligent family film ? doesn't quality count for something ? shiloh is a richly textured film populated with completely believable family and friends . it even has a villain worth hating and yet sympathetic too . shiloh has a metronome for a tail , a sweet , slobbery tongue , big soulful eyes , playfully floppy ears and an intense loyalty . the fatal flaw , of course , is that judd has no intention of ever parting with the dog , regardless of the price . in less capable hands than rosenbloom's the film could easily have dissolved into maudlin cliches . the smartly written script makes for a warm hearted and realistic tale . typical of the film's strengths are the depths of the supporting cast . michael moriarty plays marty's father as a stubborn and controlling parent , but one with a sweetness just below the surface . the battles between the parents , both on and off screen , avoids the overacting usually found in disagreements among parents in films . the script is full of homilies inserted so naturally that you don't realize they are present . \" sometimes the biggest test of love is how much you're willing to fight for it , \" says the doc . cinematographer frank byers shot the film in warm nostalgic shades of browns and golds . amy b . ancona's sets are evocative without ever being overloaded with gaudy country nicknacks . and joel goldsmith's music has a wonderful dreaminess to it . the film has a long and completely plausible resolution of the conflict , but it seems at first to lack the tension needed to make it compelling . the result is a completely satisfying picture with a touching little story , nicely resolved . shiloh runs just 1 : 33 . it is rated pg for mild violence . the show would be excellent for kids six and up . my son jeffrey , age 8 , liked the film \" very much , \" but added that it would not make his best of the year list . i recommend this fine film to your family and give it * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

( the 1957 version was itself a remake , see my previous review , of a 1954 studio one production , but that piece of cinematic trivia remains unknown to all but the most avid movie fans . ) the great director sidney lumet directed the 1957 version and the star-studded cast included such luminaries as henry fonda , lee j . cobb , ed begley , e . g . marshall , jack warden , and jack klugman . the 1997 remake produced by mgm and released on the showtime cable network has itself a superlative cast . in 12 angry men , his old talent shines through , but even so his performance is not in the same league as fonda's or robert cummings's , who played the part in 1954 . \" it's one of those open and shut things , \" points out george c . scott's character . but crying out as the lone voice of compassion , lemmon pleads , \" suppose we're wrong . \" mykelti williamson , from forrest gump and con air , wanted to get the part to show how universal racism can be . williamson even personally designed the role so that his character was a ex-member of the nation of islam . although not fully explained , apparently his character was too racist for the black muslims . \" i've lived among them all my life , \" declares williamson's venomous character about the defendant and his race . his hate is complete and unadulterated by reason or any semblance of empathy . as the story unfolds , the sure and certain facts from the courtroom turn out to be anything but . some , of course , resist mightily . \" don't give me those facts , \" complains williamson's character . \" i'm sick and tired of facts . \" although mcdonnell is a fine actor , her brief appearance smacks of tokenism . these serve no purpose and are unable to make a highly relevant story any more so . the conclusion is inevitable , but , even if you've seen the 1957 version , this remake is worth viewing for the strength of the script and the fine performances . every juror's vote change is a milestone along a hard climb . when they reach the summit , you may find yourself as emotionally drained as the jurors . it is not rated but would be pg or pg-13 for mature themes and a little profanity . the film would be fine for kids say nine and up who are interested in such serious subjects . i recommend the film to you and give it * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

( \" yes , i am nouveau riche , but it's the riche that counts . \" ) he oozes charm and confidence from every pore . eastwood stages the scenes with such naturalness that you feel right at home . ah , the living is easy . there is a reason for this and for why he always carries a bottle of poison with him , but i will let you find out . and yes , there's a good reason for that one too . movie trials need good defense attorneys . and more . \" you believe what you choose , and i'll believe what i know . \" a film that revels in ambiguity , it is a delightful piece of entertainment even if not the major film that i expected . midnight in the garden of good and evil runs a little too long at 2 : 15 . it is rated r for some profanity , some violence , and mature themes . it would be fine for most teenagers .",

            "message": "in my humble opinion , documentaries are the highest of the cinematic art form . the best documentaries can let us see worlds we have never seen before or give us fresh insights into places with which we naively think we already are familiar . from the famous documentaries like triumph of the will and hoop dreams to the spectrum of lessor known but nevertheless fascinating ones like anne frank remembered , frosh : nine months in a freshman dorm and theremin : an electronic odyssey , we learn more from them than most fictional movies . to this great tradition is added director robert epstein and jeffrey friedman's the celluloid closet which looks at the depiction of gays and lesbians in the movies from the silent films to the today's pictures . although the film will clearly appeal to homosexuals and to film buffs , i believe that anyone seeing this documentary will find it an absolutely engrossing and fascinating movie . i believe that after seeing the celluloid closet , i now have a fresh perspective on the cinema and will never see films in quite the same way again . this movie helps you in reading the subtext of the movies better than any i have ever seen . as the movie starts , narrator lily tomlin tells us that , \" hollywood , that great maker of myths , taught straight people what to think about gays and gay people what to think about themselves . \" the format of the movie , beautifully edited by jeffrey friedman and arnold glassman , is to intersperse interviews with mainly gay people in the film industry with substantial length clips of movies to illustrate their points . actor and writer harvey fierstein said , \" the hunger i felt as a kid looking for gay images was not to be alone . \" although the documentary skips around a little bit , it mainly sticks to a chronological line . during this period , there were films with more honest and open depiction of homosexuality particularly those of marlene dietrich . with the advent of the legend of decency formed by the catholic church in 1934 , the movie industry agreed to a strict code where many activities were absolutely forbidden , and the censor had control over even the small parts of the script otherwise it would not get the seal of approval and without it no theater owner would dare show the film nor any studio dare make it . after this time , gay characters continued to be in films , but they were much subtler . also , during the 30s , gays were almost always shown as villains . the documentary shows clip after clip of movies with characters that were clearly gay like peter loire in the maltese falcon , but whom were not acknowledged as being so . they said the censors were not \" rocket scientist \" and so writers got a lot of pictures past them with gay characters , and the censors were never the wiser . some of the clips you could disagree with , but clearly most of the characters they claim to be gay or lesbian are . they showed the homosexual relationships in ben-hur and said that the writer never told charlton heston about it , or he would have come unglued . you're not bad looking . . . you've never had a man . that's your problem . \" one of best interviewees is screenwriter susie bright . in the 80s films like making love began to show homosexuality in new open , honest , and explicit ways . by the 90s , the climate became much more open , nevertheless , as tom hanks says , \" there is a constant desire on the part of the studios to make characters likable . \" the movie ends with k . the celluloid closet runs a beautifully paced 1 : 42 . it is rated r for some nudity and sex scenes . personally , i think it would be fine for any teenager that is interested enough to see the picture . i think the film is great and recommend it strongly . i firmly believe i will be a better viewer and critic after being fortunate enough to have seen this documentary . the celluloid closet easily gets * * * 1/2 in my book . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

            "message": "most science fiction movies , good or bad , have a single look and set of characters that they use throughout the entire production . but not luc besson's the fifth element . every five minutes , some totally new character or special effect is introduced . this makes for a highly involving and mesmerizing film . although the film is incorrectly being marketed as the \" star wars for the 90s , \" it does have some of the imagination of the star wars saga . where it differs , is that the fifth element never takes itself very seriously . the current trend among filmmakers is to engage in a battle with the studio's finance department with the filmmakers' goal being to spend the maximum amount possible on special effects . the fifth element puts some sanity in this trend by spending every penny wisely , producing some of the most dazzling effects in a long time . if you are envisioning a depressing blade runner motif for besson's vision , think again . typical of the innovativeness is its rendering of traffic in a big city in the year 2259 . rather than heavy traffic on the one street level , the airborne cars operate on numerous but carefully controlled parallel logical surfaces . among all of the visual spectacles is a story and some excellent acting as well . bruce willis , who can be terrific but has been in so many dogs like color of night that i have begun to dread seeing his name on the marquee , plays the starring role of the taxi driver and ex-government agent korben dallas . she speaks only a sing-song style of language that baffles korben . the screenplay by luc besson and robert mark kamen has enough complexity to make following it somewhat of a challenge , but never so much as to lose the audience . working through it becomes an interesting diversion , but all eyes stay glued to the screen to see what will happen next . the fifth element is more a feast for the eyes than the mind . the film is filled with cartoonish shoot-'em-up violence , willis , as one of many shooters , plays a much more lovable character than he does in the die hard series . his enjoyment of his character transfers easily to the audience . the chemistry between korben and his sidekick leeloo pulsates with comedic and romantic energy . me protect you . \" ) with her quirky mannerisms and speech , jovovich steals most of her scenes . all of the details , right down to the barbecuing of the ugly little parasites on the spacecraft before the flight , are carefully orchestrated with maximum imagination . i believe it . the result overflows with energy and creativity . the fifth element runs 2 : 07 and is worth every minute . it is rated pg-13 for brief female nudity , cartoonish violence , and a little profanity . the film would be fine for kids say 9 or 10 and up . i had great fun at the fifth element so i recommend it to you strongly and give it * * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : may 6 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

            "message": "the defiant ones received academy awards for sam leavitt's moody cinematography with its sharp whites and gloomy grays and for harold jacob smith and nedrick young's crisp but powerful screenplay . the chase , although interesting , plays out on a minor stage with the dialog within the two groups taking center stage . in contrast to today's films , where the word \" nigger \" is thrown about as if it means nothing more than any other profanity , this movie treats it with the contempt it deserves . in their first verbal encounter in the picture , joker uses the word nigger to refer to noah . you call me that again , and i'll kill you ! \" sheriff max muller , played in an oscar nominated performance by theodore bikel , says with disgust , \" the warden's got a sense of humor . \" and he's not far off . at this point jail begins to look pretty inviting . kramer stages the scenes with such simplistic power that he gives the outdoors almost the look of a stage play -- all the better to focus the audience's attention on the words in the two dramas at hand . he shoots in tight close-ups to draw the audience into the story . with two superb performances and palpable tension , the film has a strength that rises above the simplicity of the storyline . as siamese twins , for example , their inevitable fistfight makes no sense and yet seems perfectly natural . although some scenes become a bit didactic , most have remarkable subtlety . one brief kiss , and the camera cuts away to the next morning . although i would have preferred a more dramatic and surprising ending , kramer stages the inevitable one with efficient precision , and the story seems to wind down rather than ending . but it is in the dialog that the film finds its power anyway and not the drive toward some hokey conclusion . the defiant ones runs a fast 1 : 37 . it is not rated but would be pg-13 for adult themes and a little violence and would be fine for kids around 10 and up .",

            "message": "okay admit it , when you hear the title moll flanders , you think of that racy novel from high school . yes , this is the same daniel defoe book , but an excellent director , pen densham , has made it into a marvelous character study and moving motion picture . certainly , moll flanders can be a bit bawdy at times , but compared to most popular films today , the depiction of the sex here is tame . this is cinema at its best : great actors , stirring music , impressive sets , and an intelligent script . flora is a saucy and high strung girl of about 7 who is more interested in escaping that hearing some silly old morality tale . hibble is just as determined that she will listen carefully to every single word of it . the script , which i believe is a loose adaptation of the novel , stays with spirit of the book and the cadence of the speech , but takes a lot of liberties . it paints a dickensian picture of the world that stretches credulity a bit , but it was easy for me to suspend disbelieve . i bought the story lock , stock , and barrel . mrs . mazzawatti's daughters are anything but charitable , and moll is forced to leave for quite surprising reasons that you will never be able to guess in advance . give yourself some pleasure . i'll bet you've never been kissed . \" the story is wonderfully rich and varied and always keeps the audience's attention . the ending of the film is somewhat of a surprise and is extremely effective and moving . moll flanders may produce a few natural tears . although i cried a little toward the end , i never found the script manipulative . the acting was nothing short of brilliant . it is hard to have a favorite in movies of this caliber . if forced to choose , i'll go with morgan freeman's performance as the best . this luminescent actor seems incapable of anything less than a compelling performance . although this is not his best film , he is great in it . technically the movie is on par with the high quality of the acting . in fact , even better than the acting is the script by the director pen densham and the music by mark mancina . the music has an extensive range from delicate and loving to large and dramatic . i would be pleased to see this picture win many awards , but if i had to pick one , i'd give it to mark mancina for the music . the movie was filmed entirely in ireland . the snowy scenes are bleak and yet possess an inner warmth somehow thus suggesting the possibility of hope around the next corner . the costumes ( consolata boyle ) like the sets are lush and evocative without ever being unbelievably ostentatious . my favorite costume is the stern , long blue coat with the brass buttons that hibble wears . the movie flows naturally and sometimes slowly , but always with enough energy so that you remain on the edge of your seat . also the strong mood of the picture has to be credited to the director who is able to fashion just the right pieces to make it all come together . moll flanders is listed as running 2 : 49 , but i think it might be a misprint . certainly it did seem that long . however long it is , i would not want it edited down . the film is rated r . there is the brutality of that era , but it is done tastefully . there is brief sex , some nudity , but no bad language that i can remember . it would be fine for any teenager and perhaps those a bit younger . i give this show my top recommendation and award it * * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : may 13 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",
