            "message": "a satirical film where warren beatty tries to talk the black man's rap to get across his political message : which is that there's something wrong in politics that corrupts everyone in it . maybe he does this because he feels relieved that he's going to die soon . this is an awkardly embarrassing scene , that was more embarrassing than funny to watch beatty try to ingratiate himself this way to his black brothers . it reminded me in an analogous way of the liberals in the '60s who invited the black panthers into their wealthy homes and thought they were so chic . even frank capra wasn't that schmaltzy . the story gets too ridiculous at this point to even be satirical or credible , it is just bad filmmaking ; but it does try in its unclear and scrambled way to blame the media and the rich people who control it , for not being risk takers and offering fresh arguments into the political fray . amiri baraka ( poet & playwright ) , supposedly a voice of consciousness , plays a homeless wiseman who keeps popping up from scene-to-scene , uttering this heavy stream of consciousness rap , \" we need no more ghosts , we need a spirit . \" the fault of the film , is that beatty can't gracefully pull off what he is trying to accomplish without appearing to be smug about it , like he's the white man who knows best what to do , and that anything he does is super cool because he really cares about the blacks and the poor ( sic ) . everyone in the film is a cardboard prop for beatty to lay it into them with his political cliches . just when i thought wag the dog was the stupidest political comedy i ever saw , along comes this sophomoric venture , showing no plausible way of replacing the old lies of senator bulworth with his new so-called truths , and as a result it is a film that out wags the dog's tail in silliness and prattle , unable to have the demented bulworth say what he would do when elected , except what is implied , that the people will trust him because he's so hip and daring , and he's just so with it . there was a smugness about this film that made its childish political voice seem more annoying than it should be , even taking away any enjoyment that might have been derived from its comic efforts . beatty is just not the filmmaker i would want telling my side of the story . all he has done is make a film that is cliched and overbearing and funny in a not funny way , and he sounds no different or trustworthy than the politicians he features in the film , clinton and dole . and , i don't mean that as a compliment .",

            "message": "in this kidpic , which is a very safe movie to make in today's iran , as even with the intolerant dictator khomeini dead , and a more liberal regime in its place , there is still no room for anything but subtle dissension to get sneaked into the story , because of strict censorship , and the most fertile ground to do that sneaking in , is in a type of film like this one , where there is no challenge to the ongoing political system and its fundamentalist religious system , as everything is seen through the children's eyes . the only thing , is that i couldn't pick up any subtle attacks against the regime . maybe it was too subtle for me to pick up , or maybe there was no dissensions , this was just meant to be a tear jerker of a film . the story is guileless . it is about a lost pair of shoes and a shared pair of sneakers , which if it was an american film and didn't give me a chance to see a country such as iran , which i am unfamiliar with , but curious to see how it looks under this new regime , i would have been really disappointed at how weakly structured it was . but because it is iran and i am aware how difficult it is to make a film under censorship there , i am more tolerant of its flaws than i ordinarily would be . why he doesn't tell his teacher about this problem , i don't understand , especially since his teacher seemed like a kind man , and , since this might be a problem that is not that uncommon in a school where a lot of the children are poor . but , then again , if he did that , that might have taken away the reason for making this slight film , in the first place . if this film was made in the states , its theme could be , the ny state lottery theme , \" you gotta be in it to win it . \" during the race , the filmmaker pulls out a bagful of cinematography tricks and borrowed shots from other directors to make the race an exciting one , but a race that left me unimpressed with what kind of point the filmmaker was making . if one , could summarize , how this feel good iranian version of that old hollywood standard formula works here , tugging at the audiences' heartstrings every chance it can get , as quickly as tears fall from ali's wide oval eyes and a frown covers zahra , as whenever bad news comes her way , which is most of the time , we see a frown appear on her . i assume , what the film is trying to say , is see how you must solve your problems on your own , don't blame it on the government . i guess the point being made here is , both girls can be generous and have learned how to live with their poverty . the father's poverty reflects the director's own background , which is why the family is so touchingly portrayed but in such a manipulative manner , that it fails to be as convincing a portrayal as it could have been , if done in a more free flowing form . the father is seen as a true believer , never questioning authority , deeming everything to be in the hands of god , whereas his religious beliefs are so strong , he would not even take a piece of sugar that he is chopping up for the mosque to have for his tea . this display of moral rectitude , reveals how simple things can be if you just have faith and perseverance to endure life's hardships . is this what the film is really trying to say ? but as an impactful film , it falls on its face with a thud , unable to make heaven seem to be a real place for children , where everything that is bitter is shown to be really fine despite what appears to be not so fine : rich people are not bad they can be nice , schools are not that rigid they can be accomodating , religion is unquestioned but that is because it is necessary , being poor can make you sad but it is not the worst thing in the world , and obedience is sometimes difficult to understand but it can be rewarding .",

            "message": "the nightmarish scenes seem surpassed by cinematography techniques , allowing the story to move into the realm of make believe hollywood hokum rather than relying on the viewer's imagination to do the job . the irish-born director , jordan , whose accomplishments include a few first-class films among some disappointments , only proves here , that the horror thriller , perhaps , is not what he is best suited for . his heavy-handed direction , helped only in spoiling a fine cast from doing what it is capable of . jordan's idea of a horror thriller , seems to be in letting the heroine to act in a shrill voice , rather than letting the heroine's nightmare and mental breakdown come down as something internally real . if jordan went down the poetic trail instead of opting for this gobbledy-gook he comes up with , then we might have had a solid film to comment on . it was the only scene in the movie that was able to convey how believable her panic attacks really are . i think he's delusional if he thinks he got a real part in this film . his role is so insignificant , even more so than aidan quinn's , as to make stephen rea , seem less like a star than one of the film's extras . here , he is playing the role of vivian thompson , by making his villain role as campy as he could , managing to give the impression that he is a totally evil pervert , possibly even gay . downey jr . basically brought a sense of the ridiculous to this role , allowing the film to sink lower than than the ordinary hollywood horror film usually does . the film's intellectual theme , if i can loosely use the word intellectual , is a reversal of \" snow white \" , as this time the story is not narrated from the child's point of view , but from the mother's . an adult freudian tale , i suppose . the film just becomes a mess and the acting is constantly shrill . it is a film that can't be saved by good looking photography , or diffuse symbolism , or even by great special effects , but must be viewed wallowing in its own unpleasant reservoir of putrid storytelling .",

            "message": "this is a ridiculous film . if you think about it , it just doesn't make sense . it's a tale about wishy-washy \" humanitarianism . \" that is something i just find hard to believe always happens ( opinions often change , but people ( principles ) do not ) . it's a manipulative film and if you go with the flow of the story and accept the logic presented , then everything is manufactured to make you eschew reason and be persuaded by your blind emotional responses . this is a middle-brow art film and even though it pretends to offer more , it doesn't . it should only serve those who go to films to be entertained in the way a vacuous hollywood film does , where the viewer is expected not to care how ridiculous the story is . what this film is best at doing , is having its star actors look good and have a cinematographer , like eduardo sarra ( leconte himself did a lot of the filming ) , make a static film look stimulating by beautifully photographing it . these are diversionary tactics that can easily lull one into just going into a slumber and accepting this contrived film at face value without giving it a further thought . patrice leconte ( \" ridicule \" ) latest film \" the widow of st . pierre \" is particularly annoying because it is so smug . it is a film that stacks the deck in the murderer's favor and could care less about the murder victim . if the film's aim is to make a case against capital punishment , it succeeds only in making a case for phony compassion . i'm afraid the filmmaker's aims are just to make a movie pushing its star cast into appealing fantasy roles and sucking the viewer into believing the film is serious in tackling tough issues because the stars are taking their roles in a serious manner . its moral high ground against capital punishment was not only unconvincing , but it leaves a bitter feeling in the air . do-gooders generally manage to do more harm than good , and that will prove itself in this film as well . the widow of saint-pierre is juliette binoche ( in my book , she's the julia roberts of french movies , matching the american in superficial acting techniques ) . it might be of interest to note , that guillotine is a slang word for \" widow \" in french . basically , this is a bourgeois story about the self-righteous couple wallowing in their comfort and materialism and self-aggrandizing powers . his blank look at his situation is probably what the director expects from his ideal movie viewer . this is a visually pleasing film ; it has nothing more to offer than a make believe tale about real issues and concerns that the film can't get to because of its own arrogance in filmmaking .",

            "message": "therefore the film chooses not to focus too much on the precocious kid's gift , going almost exclusively for his father's nightmarish visions to tell its tale . as a result , the lesson being becomes : never play mind games you don't understand with someone inexperienced and not completely reliable who has you under their power . though , at times , the story is close to losing it , getting enveloped in melodramatics , it manages to pull back and return to the family and their struggle with the existence of a ghost in their house and their marital problems , keeping the film suspenseful , allowing you to overlook if you care to , the many holes in the story . the film just lost control of what it had going for it that made it different from , let's say , another recent ghost film , the sixth sense , and plummeted it back into the world of the run-of-the mill films of that genre . it is illustriously shot and its ghostly visions are stunningly creepy . it also captures in its sights the good , bad , and ugly of chicago . this fast moving film has hooked onto the nuances of its working class neighborhood completely , and by being grounded with this kind of reality the ghost story becomes more effective . >from this character driven film , we learn that ghosts get angry when we don't respond to them properly . that the afterworld is a place that some of us more than others have a chance to penetrate and if we do , we better learn how to listen . kevin bacon plays the role convincingly , with just the right amount of skepticism and psychological tension , coming close but never going over the top , like a lesser actor might have been tempted to do . zachary david cope seems like a child who is used to seeing strange things all his life and is rather placid and accepting about it , playing his role as well as could be expected . but i did have some problems that what was happening to him was not more fully developed . i felt i didn't really know much more about him by the film's end than from its beginning . in both sequences ghosts are communicating with him . i just had the feeling that the kid could end up being a basket case if his folks didn't take some time to help him deal with his gift , and that even though they were hard working and nice people , they were not a very perceptive couple . what transpires is an ok ghost story , a suspenseful story of an ordinary couple trying to cope with something that they are not prepared for , and a weak murder story , that ruins the film , as it brings it down to earth in a most desultory manner . is the film worth seeing ? yes . it is entertaining and spooky , and you get taken on an emotional roller coaster ride . no . it is earthbound and contrived , and the ending is a stinker . take your pick , both answers are correct .",

            "message": "a terrific cast does not necessarily make for a good pic . the film becomes ridiculous by the time of that unbelievable romance on the run and by its finale it becomes a hopeless mess . though , it's entertaining as it takes us into the modern commercial art world and pretentiously shows what it takes to be a modern artist , let's us eyeball jodie foster in the nude , and has dennis hopper do his usual eccentric character number--this time as a hit man who wants to be loved and play the sax like charlie parker . he will then give anne a choice : i finish you now , or i let you live and you belong to me . it ends with a bunch of silly action scenes involving a helicopter chase and an oil refinery explosion . since none of it made too much sense , the fun to be found in this largely improvised flick is to see if you can get some laughs from how absurd it is . since i only got a mild dosage of laughter out of it , i was only mildly pleased with the flick . originally made for european release under the title catchfire , backtrack wasn't given a general distribution until 1991 . but in 1991 it was given back some cut film footage and released on cable . i would have hated to see the film when it made less sense than it did now .",

            "message": "when i look at the deep south , the first thing that comes to my mind is their history of racial problems . what altman has done , is paint a picture of the town , full of local flavor , trying to test us to see if we guessed right at what our first impressions of the locals was , as those of us who have not kept up with the changes in the south or have not been brought up there , might view things from an outdated way of seeing the new south , thinking the worst of them , but now surprised to find that the only thing that has not changed about our perceptions of the south , is how dull witted some of them can still be . altman's other aims are to uncover all the town's little nasty secrets that is so easily hidden by its southern hospitality and history of racism . though , the tone of altman's film is always light and never very haunting . this is one of his mild films , he doesn't penetrate deeper than the story itself takes us , even if it is tightly directed , with no visible flaws in the storyline and the film's purpose , everything about it turns out to be as pleasing as the smell of magnolias in the spring , and thereby we are cheated into seeing something that could have been most revealing , instead we are offered something that is really too bland and simplistic for its own good , even if it is a satisfying film , it is still most easily categorized into the \" feel good \" type of mold , something altman might have winced at in his heyday of filmmaking in the 70s . what is comical or tragic , depending on what kind of a sense of humor you have , is watching how the crime scene is being trampled on , and the murder investigation done in such an amateurish way , that the investigators of the little jon benet ramsey murder in boulder , colorado , would look like scotland yard investigators in comparison to this sheriff's department . their romance is a series of lustful encounters , that is mostly comical , as it adds to the story , by giving it a more local flavoring . now this is as far a cry from the old mississippi , as one can imagine , though there are still some lingering subtle racial prejudices around . which , i guess , could best be understood as a very logical statement by those who were brought up in a small-town . the film ends on cora's spiteful comment to her sister , as she sticks to the story her controlling sister gave her , that it wasn't a suicide , as she triumphantly exclaims , \" i did good , didn't i ? \" the film's decency shines through all the past racial injustices , and maybe things are getting better in the south , at least that is the message we are left with , and i see no reason to be of a different opinion . but that last framed shot of the sheriff and emma and the lawyer and willis sitting on the dock fishing was a little too rosy a picture for me to take in all at once . race relations might be the biggest problem americans are still faced with , and finding a cordial way out of it is the aim of a lot of good folks . the weakness of this film , is that its over-all decency is not moving enough of an experience to make this anything but a mildly entertaining film , that captured a little something about the south's past and future , and made us feel a little better that we saw it , but did not set off any bigger sparks , or really create any excitement about the town or its inhabitants that is worth taking note of .",

            "message": "a superficial but entertaining roller-coaster-ride of nonstop action featuring clich ? characters and contrived dangerous situations , mainly conceived to show off the special effects . the story is so slight that there is no danger of it interfering with the action scenes . it's a hollywood blockbuster for those in need of escaping reality for two hours and should prove to be enjoyable for those who are willing to go with the flow of the action and suspend their critical judgment . the reward will be a visual treat of well-executed stunts and a film that had the glossy look of a national geographic photography shoot . movie viewers could go snowblind just watching a series of mountain catastrophes befall the adventurous climbers , as the film throws out almost any possible danger there is to be found on a mountain and the mountain climbers try to overcome these impossible obstacles and , there is , needlessly to say , a race-against-time sequence , with a last second rescue in the works . the opening eight-minute scene , derivative as it is , is brilliantly done and captures whatever underlying tension the film was to later on build up to . she is still upset with what peter did and could hardly face him , much less talk to him about it . the commercial motive for the climb and the callous way he will soon treat his fellow climbers , makes him the film's designated one-dimensional villain , and adds some more spice to a film that is overspiced already with clich ? s . the rescuers will try to blast the victims out of the cavern , but must be very careful when climbing because with just one spill of the explosive liquid there is the certainty of a tremendous explosion . there will be many tremendous explosions that rock the himalayas , and -- if mountains repeatedly exploding and climbers falling down mountain peaks in colorful ways is your idea of enjoyment , then this is the film for you . the action keeps coming , the clich ? s get resolved somehow , and even though the action sequences couldn't possibly be real , the great photography and beautiful vistas made the locations seem out of this world . the filmmaker used the southern alps in new zealand as his setting , and you could have fooled me , because it sure looked like the himalayas . it also looked like it could be a long commercial for beautiful yuppie adventurers who are shooting an ad for club med , or a national geographic tv special , or even one of those action thrillers that doesn't believe it needs good dialogue to tell its heroic fantasy story .",

            "message": "it is always fascinating when a great foreign director takes a look at his own country in a way that outsiders can't really see it . he seems to have their best interest at heart and he cures them of their ills , and they know this , but the ones in charge don't seem to care and treat him as if he were a quack . i have not read the book to confirm this but this is what the director said in an interview that was reported by a film 'zine . what struck me as rather odd for the moment , until i thought further about it , was the film's opening , as the first words spoken are english that come from american bomber pilots flying over okayama , an island village next to the doctor's hometown of hibi , with a pow camp and a factory . this seems to indicate the influence america and its film industry has had on this quintessential japanese director and the need he has to show that the world is not necessarily a homogenous place , that all nations are influenced by each other . it is a rather odd philosophical opinion for one to have , especially for one who was himself getting bombed during the war ( imamura was a teen at the time of the war ) . no one in this film will get exactly what they want . this is a chaotic story that covers more topics than you could shake a stick at . this imamura film is not by any means his definitive one , but it shows enough of his lifetime concerns to be an interesting one for him to make his swan song in . what it suffers from is that the combination of comedy and serious drama have too many awkward and slow moments , that show many reactions to what the director visibly feels and makes them look as if they were predictably put into the cluttered story and don't have a breath of their own . to see how great a director he is , is to contrast those tepid scenes with some of the scenes that have his magical hand in it and see how simple and moving they were . there is no moral judgment that this is an american bomb , as it seems the philosophy here is , that when you live by the sword you must expect to die that way . the better choice for his country would have been one of practising a more loving nature , something that seems obvious , but what is also obvious is that the world has not learned that simple lesson and continues to rely on military might to fight its battles . in one conversation between akagi and sonoko , the beauty of their characters is magnified , as the deadly bacteria is viewed under the microscope and sonoko on seeing it , exclaims how beautiful it is : sonoko : \" are there men and women bacteria ? \" akagi : \" neither male nor female , just perpetual reproductive motion . \" \" that doesn't exist in nature . more fun . \" this film might not be a masterpiece ( which i don't think it is ) but it is clearly a film by a great man , a man who sees the contradictions in life in an amusing and contentiously cynical way , someone who can put the virtuous doctor in the same boat with the whore , and not be bothered by any moral judgments about who the better person is , because to him they are both beautiful . a strange farcical comedy results , that is often brilliant and at other times too messy to follow in all the cloudy trails it leads to .",

            "message": "a thrilling but shamelessly manipulative political thriller , the second feature dealing with presidential politics from the director who was once a film critic , rod lurie ( deterrence ) . he has vastly honed his skills as a filmmaker in comparison with his debut film , which was a failure artistically and commercially . \" the contender \" is a film that is grounded in having a clear understanding of how politically underhanded and sly the system is and how those in it operate on a level that would make machiavelli proud of them . i was taken aback by how great the entire ensemble cast is , with the leads being superb in getting the maximum out of their juicy roles , even if they have to chew the scenery to do it . the cast is so good that it overcomes the shrill oratory , the manipulative , obvious and unbelievable political situations , and an ending that tries to play it so safe , that it takes away the juice in the story that gave this film its power in the first place . i thoroughly enjoyed it , even though i knew it was a manipulative film , trying to get me to bite at its revelations about the double-standards between men and women politicians , without giving me a fair chance to swallow everything without choking on what i was asked to swallow . this only occurs when he orders something ordinary -- a muenster cheese sandwich . there was something about that action that didn't seem right . it will later on play an important part in the film's plot . it makes the viewer face the fact that a woman in high office is still a woman and has to be accepted just like a man in that position would be . hanson refuses to comment on the issue , taking the high moral ground , saying it is no one's business but her own . senator hanson is seen as both a liberal and a vegetarian . the story in itself is more soap opera than drama , but what gives it verve is the super performances from the three stars , jeff bridges , gary oldman , and joan allen . they give depth to their roles and they are all seen in many different lights and shades . jeff bridges steals every scene he is in , offering a fascinating look at a president who could be likable though sinister , sneakily clever , and also very politically human in a generous and gracious way . he was thoroughly believable as an updated bill clinton-type , post-lewinsky . this film is a pro-clinton one , taking aim at those who dig up dirt and cast aspersions in a hypocritical way , when it is evident that both sides are capable of using the same bag of dirty tricks to further their own cause . the film was fascinating when it didn't have a message to deliver with some bogus pat speech and , instead , set up a logical argument showing that senator hanson should be confirmed for office despite allegations of her youthful sex scandal .",

            "message": "an amazingly strange film , confusing and not thoroughly enjoyable , but a film i found more interesting than i thought possible at first viewing . this experimental film in minimalist story telling , a film consisting of disturbing visualizations and almost no dialogue , had a concept that was greater than how the film turned out . it felt at times like i was watching paint dry on the wall , but the reward for sitting through those excruciatingly redundant scenes , was in seeing something different , something that cast a spell of sorcery over a terrible incident , as i believe the film in its unique and sometimes shrill voice does justice in commenting on the violence in american society , especially against women . the film uses its impressions of the marine base as a metaphor for the social violence in today's american society , and to give it its startling look of reality , marines were used as the actors . the plot is simple . the film's boredom is broken up by camera shots of marines in conversations that we can't hear in its entirety but are treated to little snippets of , hearing mostly their curse words . because the film had no linear story and followed no chronological order , and it stressed the mundaneness of life on the base and did not film its story in the usual way a murder investigation is filmed , it appeared surreal . i thought these additions seemed to serve mostly as unneeded arty pretext . the unsettling milieu in which the crime took place , speaks volumes about why the murder might have taken place . the film seems to be telling us that it's up to us to make sense of what we've seen . though the film was dull and did not move me while i was watching it , it did something to me afterwards intellectually , it made me think of a military base , the persian gulf war , and of marital abuse , but it made me think of them without the usual concepts i bring to my thinking cap . does that make this a great film ? no . but it makes it an interesting one , a film that i can't easily dismiss . its filming of the arrest is so chilling and memorable because what is so dull and ordinary about the crime scene , is the understated reason for the origin of the violence , contrary to the way hollywood films portray violence . here it is a part of the landscape that one regularly sees but , perhaps , one doesn't really understand or want to understand what evil society has created .",

            "message": "an autobiographical film of hou hsiao hsien , grounded in the history of taiwan from 1947 through the 1950s and the early 1960s . this was a very demanding and taxing film for me to follow , not because of its slow pace and lack of action scenes , but because i didn't have a full knowledge of what taiwan was historically undergoing during that time frame , therefore the many innuendoes and references to past events , didn't always connect with me , as well as it should have . i could only watch the film from the point of view of what i got from the film itself . and , that is , the story of a family , trying to cope with their own secrets and their own idiosyncrasies , that proves to be a very human tale , something along the lines of an ozu film . but he is also shown acting like a typical child playing games and running around with the other children , enjoying a rich childhood , growing up with many pleasant memories . the film is shot through the point of view of ah-ha . what is beautiful about the film is its lushness , the sunny colors it evokes , giving it a strange sense of touching down on a paradise , and the small matters that are very human that it pays very close attention to , like the softness of the rain falling , his father sitting so nobly by his desk , grandmother acting so eccentric and being loved by the family for what she is . this is a very subtle and wonderfully crafted film that depicts childhood in a very simple but relevant manner , that only a very few filmmakers have been able to do in such a sentimental but unsentimental way . this is a work of considerable merit . review on 2/2/99",

            "message": "this film will evoke memories of films such as chinatown and the bad and the beautiful , and of the starlets of that era , lana turner , veronica lake , and rita hayworth . the feel of the movie is of nostalgia for the hollywood glamorous life of that period , at least it presents what we are led to believe is glamorous , while the paparazzi click their cameras at the action and work hand-in-hand with the cops , hoping to catch a hollywood figure with narcotics , or in bed with someone who they shouldn't be with , or get the goods on some commies in hollywood . there are so many wonderful performances , that it is difficult to say which one is the best , but the russell crowe , dumb tough guy , muscle man cop , takes the cake as far as i am concerned , it gives the film the raw energy and view point it wants to get across , as he believes whole heartedly in what he is doing , as he beats confessions out of those accused of crimes and works over others to get information . and believe it or not , these are the two most virtuous ones in this flick . cromwell is deceptively engaging as the police chief , with a heavy irish accent and with the demeanor of a politically connected cop , who could look you straight in the eye and make you feel as if you were talking to someone who has the goods on you . his role in the film is crucial for our understanding of the underlying sentiment of how the l . a . police force has relished its role as savior for the citizenry , even if it has to defy what the book says is the right way to conduct a criminal investigation . the film is long , but it moves at a very brisk pace , covering a multitude of sub-plots . the most disturbing thing about the movie , might not be that disturbing if you believe that justice doesn't work , anyway , and that if the criminal element gets pounded on , then , so what , they are only criminals who would be getting away with crime completely if not for these rogue cops . maybe the filmmakers are right in their slick attitude , or maybe this film is just pure entertainment . but the film loaded the deck for any other argument , and that is what deters me from going overboard and praising this film to the heavens , even if it is an exceptionally well-made , cynically humorous , and terrifically acted picture ; but , yet , it might not be as great as it appears , since its subliminal message is that you can't change the system .",

            "message": "what is going on inside her , is seen through the marvelously constructed dream sequences of her in africa- as a griot , an african musical storyteller , chants out an indecipherable medley of very potent songs- that are very emotionally received by her . this is the kind of filmmaking bertolucci does best . there is an element of vague beauty and mystery in these sequences that evoke a sense of wonder . strangely enough , their past seems to be becoming more and more inconsequential . the imponderable emotions of love are caught in the music , the stunning visual spectacle of the film , and in the quietude of their personalities . how this works out , is how hard to say . it wasn't easy for me to be sure if love meant the same thing for both of them . the glib ending didn't help me understand them any better , as it felt like something was missing from their relationship , something that either i didn't catch or something that was just left out of their relationship that shouldn't have been . their acting was first-rate and very unnerving , we could see their thinking and emotional process unfolding on screen ; it is ultimately what makes this film somewhat special . the up and down career of bertolucci , is up again after this less than epic film ( actually made for an hour tv program , but lengthened for the sake of a feature movie ) . it is the kind of small art story that bertolucci seems to excel in more than with some of his more recent commercial ventures ( little buddha , the last emperor ) . that even though this story was an obvious and abbreviated one , it was still a joy to see . what the story means , is not tied in with some of the director's political or psychological ideas of the past . this is more or less a film that lives through its style and grace of letting the two of them tell their story without much help from the script . and it worked out better than these kind of films usually do , mainly because there is a power in bertolucci's direction that maybe someday he can put it all together and live up to the potential that was once expected of him . all his films are worth looking at , and this one more so than what i have seen in a long time from him . it sort of grows on you , and seems more emotionally satisfying the more you think about it .",

            "message": "there is something about this chic look at modern english society- one that is filled with wanton sex , drugs , and violence- that is more frightening than all the mayhem , perversities , muggings , and rapes it shows on screen . i think that something has to do with the fear we have of trusting the young people depicted in the film with the future of the country . the film is shot in such pleasingly stylish colors , especially the orange background , whereby the film gets its title from . it is so visually splendid a film , that it is shameful that we are confronted with so much violence , as it seems that even the violence as presented and choreographed is all too entertaining for the grim message it is trying to deliver . one might be beguiled into expecting a musical film to be taking place , if one were not aware that kubrick was the director . sex is the old in-and-out thing ; if they want an auto they just steal it , and for someone they don't like , they just pummel them . there is a strong enough reaction to these things to induce a nausea in him . kubrick's look at society is an unduly pessimistic one . there is something evil in society , but what to do about it , that is the question that remains . at least , for kubrick , we better think about what we are doing to ourselves , before it is too late . the most frightening part of the film , was that all the extremes of violence and cultural debasement , are pretty close to what the norms of society actually are . i was left feeling unsure of how to take the film's message . was there a moral ambiguity exhibited toward the violence ? there just doesn't seem to be much to think about as alternatives to the way the problem youth was handled . the film adaption from anthony burgess' satiric novel , results in a pure kubrick over-indulgent , brilliantly visual and graphic film . the jargonistic language used ( called nadsat- an onomatopoetic combination of english , russian , and slang ) made for a most arresting film , one that can't be put aside without thinking about what kind of impact it makes on how we view such moral and ethical problems . but i just don't think we come away knowing anything more about what to do about these problems than before seeing the film . nevertheless , i did find it to be a visual joyride , something that is terrifyingly pertinent in an eerie sort of way ; a memorable film , one that has become ingrained in our culture and must be looked upon as one of those 'important' films that one should see . i just didn't think it reached the level of some of his other masterpieces ( 2001 , paths of glory , the killing , eyes wide shut , and dr . strangelove ) , that , for me , were on more solid intellectual footing .",

            "message": "lynn hershman leeson is the director/writer of an intriguing cyber-fantasy film . it is a film that is strong on ideas about artificial life , memory , and immortality ; and , in the innovative technology it uses to convey its virtual reality story by using the latest in cutting edge technology , such as digital software photoshop programs . the film was structured around the idea of a double helix to be visualized in every scene and shot by using a dna image as a model for the actors' placement and camera movement . the actors appeared before nothing but a bluescreen and were photographed with a digital betacam and this was then transferred to computer images depicting the same victorian bed-and-breakfast rooms where ada byron king actually resided , the actors and the authentic rooms were then seen together in the live video . the film is much weaker on its drama than on its technology , as its characters seem to pale a bit besides the computerized images of artificial life that it created . nevertheless , for computer geeks , this is a definite must see ; for others , it should be of considerable interest to the more intellectual-minded who like to see something different for a change in a film , in a film that also has the ability to challenge the usual concepts of what reality is thought to be . as envisioned by ada , this information can lead to composing music and creating a poetic language . one of his pearls of wisdom goes something like this , \" information is like a mist that you have to breathe in . \" the concept offered in this film , of the possibility to retreat to the past for communication with historical figures and to gather information from stored memory , is an alluring idea and is certainly one that gives this intelligently made film a highbrow premise worth savoring . what weakness' there are to the story , come about from its complications in its storytelling and the didactic way it explains so much of its mathematical theory to an audience that needs this vital information made clear in order to help them make sense out of what is taking place-- but this ruins the entertainment value of the film and curtails its natural flow . as a result , that very riveting performance of a first-class actress , one of the very best , the illuminated tilda swinton ( orlando ) , is overshadowed by the film's inability to be more energetically engaging , though some effort was made to bring more life and passion into the story by showing both emmy's and ada's sexual passions unfold . but the story couldn't completely connect with all the characters involved and bring out their side of the story . if the film remained more focused on ada's story and we understood her work a little bit more , and if we saw why babbage got credit for the invention not her , it would have been in all probability an even better film . swinton is that good of a performer to have carried this film further if given more camera time . the film's ingenuous structure and imaginative nature suffered some dents because it misplaced its focus , not staying with the part of the story that was truly unique and inspiring . yet for those on the lookout for a brainy non-hollywood film , one that has an original flare to it , this one should prove to be more than satisfactory .",

it felt good seeing alvin's journey find closure . the sentimentality of the film was kept to the minimum and lynch did not try to make this small story grander than what it was , and that's a good thing , because the smallness of the story is what made this film seem so elegant and it is also what made it seem epic . but , in a film that goes only surface deep in uncovering the mythos about small-town america and its elderly , it becomes unfortunate that the filmmaker couldn't delve deeper and get more out of the story , as it seems as if this is a story waiting to be pried open even wider by someone who is not stuck on what seems to be the obvious but wants to make some waves with the politics of such small-town conservatism and question why the towns look so dry and shrivelled-up , the people seem so unintellectual , and the places visited so dull , notwithstanding , how kindly its citizens can act in an emergency . after initially being very pleased with the film , i got to wondering what i learned about alvin straight that i didn't know when the film began ; and , though i thought that alvin's reflections about his life were genuine , i still didn't really know what he is all about by the film's end , even if i now knew his darkest secret , and that is what troubles me most about this film . there is something about his life that makes me think of alvin as not only a likable character , which is what i found him to be , but someone who is so set-in-his-ways that he cannot evolve further , and he is someone who is so accepting of the \" american way of life , \" that it seems a shame that he can't find anything to say that questions the america and its institutions he was prepared to give his life for during ww11 . he would be someone who would make a good poster boy for the religious right . there seems to be no rebel in alvin , as lynch seems to accept his status quo without any hesitation . alvin , for all his appeal , just seems to be another blind follower of the so-called american value system . it was difficult for me to see lynch's motivations for making this simple story without offering any ruffles in the feathers of the american eagle . though , he certainly has a right to see things the way he does ; it , nevertheless , is disconcerting to see a film that is so accepting of the institutional american values without even questioning them . but if this is just a mild tale about an old-timer , doing something a little ornery , then it works and is pleasant to look at , just like it is pleasant to have a conversation on main street with some real people . it makes you feel good , but is that challenging enough ? i still don't know what lynch's motivation is for making this walt disney family value production film , except it seems to be an ode to traditional values , which seems odd coming from him , especially since he is known , rightly or wrongly , for making films that are supposed to be on-the-cutting-edge . there was nothing daring about this film , as its appeal is mostly through the magnificent performance of richard farnsworth , who is a movic relic , chiseled in dignity with his weather-beaten face and his geezer-like sensibilities shining through . he is someone beyond acting criticism , and whatever failings or misplaced points there are to his story , the film is still a relatively interesting work , retaining something about the american mythos that is worth investigating further ; this is a film that is well-crafted and well-worth seeing , and this is so because lynch knows how to film a story in a thoroughly professional manner . as for lynch personally , i don't have the foggiest idea what his real beliefs are or what his changing career moves might mean , but as far as this film goes , he seems to be very accepting of the status quo .",

            "message": "but until then , it just seemed like a very entertaining pop culture film , whose satire comes about in comic-strip form , as it tweaks the side of sensibility in favor of perversity . but then again , it is quite possible that the film is so polemic and so full of contempt for society , that its theme revolves around the scientists surviving in a wasteland anyway they can ( maybe a referral to t . s . if that is the case and i suspect it is , then this film becomes a more sublime work than i thought at first , chewing off more than what can be seen . its ideas do not completely vanish in flames by the film's end but just smolder , even though the film never veers from being nihilistic . the dutch-born paul verhoeven ( starship troopers/total recall/showgirls/basic instinct ) , a director i never thought much of before as being subtle , thoroughly hating his fascistic parody , starship troopers , and being only mildly accepting of his other sleazy films , directed this thriller with an eye to his staple signature as an auteur -- of misanthropy and lurid erotic behavior combined with mindbending special-effects . the special effects are truly stunning , as we watch the gorilla become invisible , as her body when it changes looks like one of those see-through bodies in an anatomy textbook . i might not have had much use for the creepy sebastian , but i understood his human defects : his selfish motivations and his sexual curiosity , as annoying as those faults may be , at least it is something that was explored by the director in his invisible man theme , something other filmmakers of invisible men films haven't done , giving fire to the role kevin bacon so ably played . i also found elisabeth shue to be alluring , offering beauty and vulnerability , a sense of feminine instinctiveness , intelligence and of endeavor , in a film that caught an hypnotic sense of cynicism and ran with it . the remaining cast members looked as if they would be part of a research team and filled the film with the proper atmosphere needed . this is not a slasher film per se but it could be , it had all the gore required for a movie appealing to teens looking for a film with a quick mindless thrill . i found it to be most like a pop culture treat ala hollywood , adding its own brand of vitriolic delights to the sci-fi/horror genre , which has spawned many films with much the same tendencies , such as \" aliens \" and \" the fly ( 86 ) , \" but none with the same erotic tendencies and magnificent special effects . this one's a visual delight , much more intense and sleazier than the other recent similar films of this type , but one that can only push the pop culture button so far , because what does it all mean seems to be lost in the hollowness of the story itself .",

            "message": "a wonderful film . mike leigh's valentine to the theater . this 160-minute musical epic ( just right in length--the film was never dull for a second ) , moves at its own very satisfying speed , enhanced by the magnificent musical arrangements of carl davis and replete with many hilarious episodes ( it's a very funny film ) . it also has an opulent cinematography by dick pope , the eye-pleasing stagework of gary yershon , the just right costumes by lindy hemming and the impeccable performances by all concerned , with special kudos to jim broadbent as the constantly sulking and cranky librettist william schwenk gilbert . leigh makes this into a story about what happens backstage : capturing the arduous process of creating a gilbert and sullivan show from scratch , accurately depicting the petulance of the actors , the reality of the business side of show business , those dreaded rehearsals , and all the delicate balancing of egos that come into play , as the director pushes for the performances he wants . it couldn't be more real or more tempered with total affection for what the actor and writer must go through to get what they want out of their work . it is as good a story about the backstage happenings as any in films , and is so much superior than shakespeare in love , which basically did the same thing last year and was rewarded with an oscar . it was amazingly well done to watch his facial and bodily transformation from one of a grouch to unmitigated joy in an instant , as his love for his work is written all over him . as \" the mikado \" goes into rehearsal , gilbert forcefully directs the play and the actors are just as brilliantly daunting whether rehearsing or cavorting backstage , or performing for an audience . one of leigh's pet themes over the years , is for actors to do improvisations . his meaty part couldn't be played to greater perfection , in a performance that is memorable , making it difficult not to think of broadbent whenever the name gilbert will now be mentioned . topsy-turvy captured best director and best film honors in the new york film critic awards . but with the success of the mikado , gilbert tells his wife that he can't handle such happiness , \" there's something inherently disappointing about success . \" musicals don't get any better than this offbeat one . he is so sure of what he is doing , the film is so well researched for authenticity without having to put the film in a period straight jacket , that it retains a refreshingly modern attitude despite being properly set in victorian times . the beauty of the film , making it so much more than the typical musical , is that the director caught the environment of victorian society , allowing it to add a socio-historical perspective to the backstage dramatics of the theater people and to the travails of the g & s partnership . this historical perspective was depicted , by flashing the newspaper headline of the death of general gordon and his men in the khartoum massacre on the screen and then the film zeroes in on some actors stuffing themselves on oysters , basking in the bourgeois society the empire has made possible for them and so many others in england . but the director's main point wasn't political as it usually is , he merely wishes to show what a colossal effort it is to put on a stage show and that g & s individually would have undoubtedly found great success alone , but it is only with their collaboration that their success is so magnificent , and that we should be grateful for what their partnership gave the world . i'm also grateful that leigh made this film . i felt just wonderful leaving the theater . i knew that i saw something special .",

            "message": "stanley kubrick's first big financed a film and first film with a major hollywood star . kirk douglas who liked the script , thinking it would give him a chance to work on a quality film with a strong social message , thereby getting his production company to back it . this antiwar film , one of the best ever made , much like renoir's masterpiece \" the grand illusion , \" does a great job of criticizing the role of the french military higher-ups in ww1 . the movie turns most of its attention to the action taking place in a military courtroom court-martial and the interplay between the officer's political manuevering for power . kubrick's masterpiece was more cynical and gritty than renoir's very poetic and humane indictment of war . one reason why this was so , was because it hit harder at those who were its subjects and as a result many country's reacted so vehemently as to officially oppose the film . it should also be pointed out , that the ambitious kubrick rewrote the original script to give the film a more traditional hollywood upbeat ending to it , much to kirk douglas's surprise and disapproval . kubrick , reportedly , wanted the film to be a box office success and was willing to forgo artistic integrity . the controversial ending might be termed a cop-out by many , while others found its sentimentalities quite appropriate and cynical enough . incidentally , in my opinion , the major flaw in paths of glory wasn't the taut script , which was lucid and hard-hitting , but it was in kirk douglas's egomaniacal performance ( though a strong performance and the best one in kirk's career ) . but , as forceful and necessary as kirk's performance was , it still allowed the film to become centered around him , rather than on the universality of the story unfolding in its very natural and engrossing way about the horrors , evils , and insanity of war . kubrick aimed for a critique both of war and of class systems . he accomplished this by pessimistically and cynically showing how the privilege class cares only about themselves and how its power is corrupting . we are told that world war i has dragged on for two years and that it became a stalemate of fortified trenches and heavy casualties . war but then broulard says that a promotion awaits , there will be consideration for another star . after dax says it is not possible to do , mireau says , \" show me a patriot and i'll show you an honest man . \" but mireau , not to be undone in the generosity of the moment , says let's make it 3 and have the 701st's three commanding officers choose one from each outfit . broulard says we better get a court-martial for them and make it legal . angrily , dax turns him down , as broulard looks at him incredulously , as if he were a fool , saying you really cared about saving those three men , you are an idealist . dax tells him to give the men a few minutes . the film is direct and powerful . it wouldn't have been banned for so long if it didn't hit home with its hard message . it is magnificently shot , as the trenches are frighteningly real and incomprehensible to understand until seen . kirk douglas is overwhelming in his stabilizing role , in my opinion too much so . but , nevertheless , his anger is warranted , as he is the emotional glue that holds the film together and gives humanity some measure for hope . though i came away from the film feeling no hope . i was cynical of everyone's motives , including dax's . to call him a hero , as the ending of the film implies by its crass sentimentality , as it shows him going back to the front , left me cold . adolphe menjou and george macready came through with outstanding performances , each one an incarnation of machiavellian evil . when on screen , their performances are like machine gun fire directed at you . there is much to chew on idea-wise , despite how simple the film might appear on first viewing it , and thereby lies its true greatness , as it seems to make a timeless argument against war ; and , as in most kubrick films , it is not dated , in fact , it seems to get better with age .",

            "message": "since the film didn't have a director , the film's star , charlton heston , suggested to the people at universal that they get orson to direct it ( this is heston's version ) . it was magnificently photographed by emphasizing the contrasts between dark and light shades as filmed by the great cinematographer russell metty , which abetted the imaginative tale , whose main story is about the downfall of the sleazy , obese lawman played with sheer brilliance by orson . it's a b-film more powerful and hard-boiled than the weak-minded upper-studio heads at universal could handle . the video that came out in the '70s was an interpretation of the three re-edited versions , which was far removed from the way orson wanted it seen . the film ended up as a box office disappointment , giving ammo to those in hollywood who said that he could only make an art film and not a commercial one . orson refused to recognize the version that universal sent to the movie theaters as his film , in fact he called it an 'odious thing . ' never fully receiving the recognition that the film should have gotten for the masterpiece it was , it was even considered by some film critics to be a disappointing welles film , not comparable to his masterpiece of \" citizen kane . \" the film , nevertheless , got recognized abroad , especially by the french new wave directors and eventually the film was starting to get a following among young intellectuals in this country and started to get its just recognition for the poetically visionary and original film it was . it was a film that did things films never did before , both technically and as a hard-hitting baroque thriller . it was the first film to have natural dialogue in a moving car . it is arguably the greatest opening shot in film history because of its visual impact in setting up the feature's characters and the tenseness of the story that was to follow . orson used a hand-held camera and specialized not only in wide-angle shots but by his constant intercutting , he was able to keep the action flowing and the story suspenseful . the film had been restored somewhat by 1978 for its video distribution and it picked up some running time from how it was first shown at 96 minutes and now it was back to its original time of 108 minutes . in the 1990s the film was finally pieced together from the memo orson sent the studio and the hack director's scenes were cut , and it picked up an additional three minutes . the effort to restore the film to the way orson originally shot it , allowed the story to become clearer and for the film to have the shape the artist wanted it to have . this is about the closest we could get to the way orson filmed it , since he passed away in 1985 and we have no other idea about what else he may have wanted to do with the film . spoiler : for those who don't want to follow the rest of the story , please stop reading at this point and resume reading the last paragraph , which makes some further points about the film . the subtle beauty of this scene , is in the restored version , where it looks as if the machine killed him . fans of the cinema should be pleased with this restored work and after seeing it will have a chance to judge for themselves which version is the masterpiece . there should be no doubt about what that choice should be . for cinefiles , thanks must go out to those who put in such a worthwhile effort to get this restoration accomplished .",

            "message": "screenplay : ken friedman and yolande finch . director : jonathan kaplan . i'd be willing to bet that someone sold the concept for bad girls with a one-line pitch like , \" the wild bunch in bloomers . \" such is the way in hollywood these days . besides , with the paucity of good roles for women , talented actresses like madeleine stowe and mary stuart masterson will jump at that chance to shoot guns . the problem is that these prefabricated films almost never bring along a script . bad girls is always either hopelessly cliche or insufferably stupid--and usually both . the women and the gang of thieves repeatedly cross paths until it becomes clear that this movie ain't big enough for the both of 'em . bad girls is frequently so incoherent that i was forced to wonder whether director had chopped all the raw footage into two minute chunks , strewn them about on the editing room floor and pieced the film together in whatever order he happened to pick them up . screenwriters ken friedman and yolande finch couldn't be bothered with such niceties as explaining why eileen and lily might want to save cody ( at least anita was the one cody saved ) . there is not a second spent letting these characters interact first , so that there seems to be some kind of connection between them . apparently it's enough that they're sisters in the world's oldest profession . wild guess , anyone ? . . . the thing is that this subplot is not only cliche , it's put together in the least economical way possible , with the inclusion of kid jarrett's aging father ( robert loggia ) . this additional character just muddles the movie further ; in fact , i would go so far as to say that the inclusion of the entire josh subplot is unnecessary . but that would have left cody without a love interest , and we couldn't have that , now could we ? oh , but there's more , pardners . in the last two minutes , there is the suggestion that lily harbors a more intimate affection for eileen , something we are completely unaware of until the music swells to a tear-jerking crescendo which means nothing because we have been given no background . james legros makes an appearance as a simple homesteader who wins eileen's heart , but his is the only performance that isn't completely perfunctory . madeleine stowe and mary stuart masterson are two of my favorite current young actresses , and both are forced to spout dialogue which puts the \" hack \" back in hackneyed . director jonathan kaplan apparently had no idea what to do with a western , so rather than set up his own shots he tries to do his half-hearted homage to sam peckinpah , with disastrous results . whole set pieces are ripped off from the wild bunch , and kaplan's use of slow motion becomes absurdly comic . the cinematography is quite good , but a big pile of garbage is a big pile of garbage no matter what kind of filter you put over the lens . sometimes you can look at a film as bad as bad girls and see the germ of an interesting idea that was undeveloped or simply butchered , but not here . there isn't the faintest attempt to make bad girls a real examination of the plight of women in the american west ; the women are just a gimmick , unlike in the ballad of little jo . bad girls is lazy , stupid , sloppy and , worst of all , boring . they are women , hear me snore .",

            "message": "squat little extraterrestrial with a telescoping neck . well , actually , it's a golden retriever named buddy . from the trailers and promotions for air bud , you might be expecting a rambunctious sports comedy about a bad-team-made-good in the recent disney tradition , with a hoops-playing pooch leading a basketball team to victory -- sort of the mighty dogs . with a few token exceptions , it's nothing of the kind . screenwriters paul tamasy and aaron mendelsohn want air bud to be a touching story of a lonely boy and his dog , something warm but slow-paced , something decidedly _not_ the mighty dogs . given the formulaic drivel disney usually passes off as live action entertainment , that noble goal alone should have made air bud worth supporting . young kevin zegers is a decent enough actor , but he's fighting against some tough precedents when he tries to make his friendship with buddy uniquely compelling , as well as fighting against charles martin smith's languid direction . the second mistake is purely the fault of disney's marketing department , which will be luring unsuspecting kids and their parents to what they believe is going to be a slapstick comedy . buddy's impressive basketball tricks might make a nice five-minute visit with letterman or leno , but they're not the stuff a feature film is made of . with the exception of one minor chase scene and the big basketball game finale ( which features the ridiculous fiction -- and anyone who has ever been to a middle school basketball game will realize this -- of a middle school basketball game with a score in the 80s and a team which runs a pivot game reminiscent of medowlark lemon-era globetrotters ) , air bud is achingly slow . twice as many children in the screening audience were roaming the aisles as were enraptured by the less-than-antic antics of josh and buddy . it's tough to knock a family film which dares to avoid bodily function humor , but air bud simply has no focus or direction , a fact made abundantly clear when the ridiculous basketball game finale gives way to an even more ridiculous courtroom finale . air bud is really deserving of praise for only one reason : it's not what it's being sold as . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line \" subscribe \" .",

[warning : elements of this review may be considered spoilers . proceed at your own risk . ] on the off chance that the rest of the film hadn't already irritated you or bored you to distraction -- and trust me , it will do one or the other -- keith gordon's waking the dead offers a special treat during its climactic scene . the wrongness of that setting may not strike you immediately , until you consider the context . without any identification . any guesses as to whether a real , living person would have pulled off that tidy little stunt ? it's a truly logic-numbing moment , but it's indicative of why waking the dead is such a catatonic failure . gordon lays on the brooding score , the lingering close-ups and the ominous fades-to-white , apparently intent on creating a phil spector-like wall of despair . as a tone piece , it's beyond reproach ; if you don't clue in to how waking the dead is supposed to make you feel , you've probably fallen asleep . not that anyone could blame you . waking the dead may do a splendid job of manufacturing gloom , but it's incapable of giving you any reason to care about its characters . crudup and connelly are steady , competent actors , but there's nothing they can do to make the relationship between fielding and sarah as transcendently life-changing as we must believe it was . in fact , gordon shows almost no understanding for how to play his most critical emotional moments . gordon's litany of miscalculations adds up to a film that clearly wasn't constructed to build characters . every supporting character is an afterthought -- wasting janet mcteer , as fielding's sister , should warrant some sort of fine -- but that doesn't explain why even the main characters are afterthoughts . in an ironic late piece of dialogue , sarah warns fielding to view her as a complete person , \" not an image , not an idea . \" images and ideas are all gordon and company have in waking the dead ; there's not a complete person to be found in this scattershot narrative . there is plenty of atmospheric intensity , though , plenty of bodies wracked with sobs and plenty of evocative lighting and/or iconography . and there's a final confrontation that effectively evokes surreality . it's effective because there's nothing to ground it -- or anything else in waking the dead -- in the reality of human experience . without any identification . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject \" subscribe \" .",

            "message": "promotional posters for she's so lovely describe it as \" a film by nick cassavetes from a fable by john cassavetes , \" a tag-line which prompted a visit to my american heritage dictionary : 1 ) a concise narrative making an edifying or cautionary point , often employing as characters animals which speak and act like human beings . \" i suppose you could say that she's so lovely fits that definition , in the sense that it makes a cautionary point . as for animals acting like people , you won't find any in she's so lovely . people acting like animals . . . well , that's another story . there is at least a convincingly seamy aura to the portion of she's so lovely devoted to eddie and maureen's kinetic romance . vintage cassavetes ambiance drips from the depressingly silent flop houses and dive bars , and from the characters wandering around in a directionless , drunken daze . yet even in its best moments , she's so lovely feels not quite right . it's like the steak transported through the telepods in david cronenberg's version of the fly , a story from another era which has been rendered synthetic in its transport to 1997 . despite the strong performances and affectingly crazy exploits of penn and penn , there's the feel of an homage to the first half of she's so lovely . it has no unique identity . to show you how far looking for a unique identity gets you , witness the second half of she's so lovely . but young cassavetes treats the whole episode as the wacky premise for a profane situation comedy , as though papa had banged out a very special episode of \" my two dads \" twenty years ago . the whimsical score by joseph vitarelli consistently undermines the seriousness of the matters at hand ; situations like eddie's appointment with an effeminate hairdresser are treated as atmospheric goofiness . instead of wondering whom maureen will end up with , your mind wanders to why nick didn't go all the way and use a laugh track . for that matter , it's not clear what john was thinking when he wrote it , with its half-realized characters , awkwardly constructed narrative and weightless romantic triangle . there's a lesson to be learned here , something like \" it's best to let sleeping scripts lie . \" here endeth the fable . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line \" subscribe \" .",

            "message": "screenplay : lowell ganz & babaloo mandell . director : ron howard . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 118 minutes . you'd think that the makers of edtv could take comfort in critic roger ebert's dictum that \" a movie isn't about what it's about , it's _how_ it's about what it's about . \" edtv , the filmmakers could argue , is about some of those same themes in a different way . sure , like the truman show it's about a man's life turned into 24-hour entertainment , but director ron howard could still make the claim that edtv is unique . and he'd be right , for all the worst possible reasons . edtv is a shallow and jokey rendering of its subject , a toothless satire that fades before the last punchline . hard to say , since we're not exactly to privvy to what ed's values were in the first place . the closest lowell ganz & babaloo mandel's script comes to defining ed is suggesting that he's basically a lazy simpleton who figures he can hit the big time by becoming a celebrity without doing any actual work . trouble is , that kind of personality wouldn't instantly endear ed either to his televsion audience or to us , so instead he's made a nice-guy rascal who scratches himself jes' like reg'lar folks . in short , he's a bore , as the subject of a television show and the subject of a feature film . even with a lackluster leading man , edtv might have worked if there had been any spark to its satire . how very bizarre to watch it instead morph into a kind of a meta-commentary on its own mass media sentibilities . as \" edtv \" becomes a phenomenon , we watch a parade of celebrities offer cameo commentary on ed-mania : ariana huffington , george plimpton , filmmaker michael moore , jay leno , bill maher , etc . edtv often aims to score points simply by trotting out famous faces , then finds no irony in a film about fame-for-fame's-sake which includes zingers from rupaul . even the endless series of advertisements on \" edtv \" feels more self-serving than sardonic ; aside from the clever use of a trojans ad during one of ed's romantic trysts , they feel like someone trying to have his product placement cake and eat it too . edtv still manages to be sporadically amusing , thanks largely to the gag-meister sit-com style of ganz and mandel . martin landau turns in a sharp supporting performance as ed's wheelchair-bound stepfather , and howard comes up with a couple of nicely-observed touches like the viewing parties that pop up around ed's first on-air sex . in general , though , ron howard is a sentimentalist with about as much edginess as a teletubbie . he's more interested in making edtv a fairly generic romanctic comedy than in digging into the reasons behind americans' video voyeurism , or examining how , in a post-modernist twist , our awareness of \" reality \" television has made reality just as staged as drama . in the end , edtv really is about the subject of mass media in its own way . it's about how much easier it is to let the viewers feel good than it is to tell them what they need to hear . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject \" subscribe \" .",

            "message": "the collaboration of these two individuals , along with one of the fall's most compelling trailers , gave me high hopes for fearless . it only delivered halfway . fearless contains a handful of gripping moments and one outstanding performance by bridges , but it also has some hollow interpersonal moments and a lack of focus that holds it back from real greatness . indeed , fearless maintains an intense , hypnotic energy for the first fifteen minutes , as max's odd new persona takes hold . then , rather abruptly and much to the worse , it shifts gears into fairly run-of-the-mill family drama . this tangent of the story doesn't work for two basic reasons . one , laura isn't all that interesting , and rossellini doesn't succeed in projecting any warmth or concern . second , max is such a jerk that i felt everyone would have been better off if he had just left . screenwriter rafael yglesias , adapting his novel , doesn't have the guts to really attack max's arrogance , and weir lets his christ imagery ( max probing a wound in his side ; max making mud from his saliva ) just sit there without any irony . their relationship is handled delicately , and avoids the too obvious step into romance . but again there are swings into scenes without a note of truth , like an awkwardly acted group therapy session . by the time fearless hits its wrenching climax , a flashback to the moment of the crash wonderfully scored by maurice jarre , i felt as though i had been through a ride as bumpy as the passengers on that plane had . while max klein's character may not have endeared itself to me , bridges' performance did . like he did in starman , bridges carries himself like an alien among us , but this time an alien with some smugness . this performance shores up my judgment of bridges as the best american leading actor around , and it almost holds fearless together on its own . however , fearless takes its metaphysics too seriously , and doesn't keep its eye on what works best : the reactions of two survivors to a world now seen with different eyes .",

            "message": "for approximately five minutes , the computer-animated dinosaur is undeniably spectacular . the story creeps up without dialogue , following the fate of one little dinosaur egg from its trampled , abandoned nest across an astonishing primeval landscape . seven years removed from the revolutionary screen creations of jurassic park , i didn't think it would be possible for the mere sight of digital dinosaurs to seize the imagination , but it happens in dinosaur nonetheless . with its entirely visual storytelling , dinosaur's prologue offers a giddiness-inducing prospect : an introduction to a lost world as quietly , primally engrossing as kubrick's \" dawn of man \" prologue to 2001 : a space odyssey . and then a cute little simian opens its stupid mouth . i knew going into dinosaur that it was a disney film aimed at kids , so i can't say i was expecting anything more profound than the story it ultimately provided . that didn't make its presence any less disappointing . yaaaaaaawwn . disney's animated features have generally been pretty formulaic , so it's no shock to discover that dinosaur features a by-the-numbers script . this variation , however , is so relentlessly somber and dreary that there's nothing left but formula . the personalities of the principal characters are so bland and the vocal performances so uninspired that the characters threaten to disappear into the backgrounds -- no small feat considering the overwhelming brown-ness of the desolate post-apocalyptic scenery . even the minor characters like zini and eema -- those theoretically present to provide a little comic relief -- can't inject any life into the film . in recent disney films , the musical numbers have come off as purely obligatory , but i found myself pleading for a snappy tune to breathe some life into the film . it's hard to imagine what young viewers would find to embrace in this grim production , and even harder to imagine what would keep an adult awake . there's no denying that the technology involved in the creation of dinosaur is extraordinary , mixing the computerized cast with some real-world settings so seamlessly that it's virtually impossible to tell where reality and hard drive overlap . apparently , however , co-director ralph zondag has become no more adept at dinosaur-driven storytelling than he was for the limp 1993 animated feature we're back ! that film seemed rushed into theaters to capitalize on that summer's jurassic juggernaut . this one misses its opportunity to step out of the spielbergian shadow , gradually devolving into a series of all-too-familiar set pieces . that's a sad end to a film that begins with so much promise . better to recycle disney's orphan fetish without a whiff of personality or humor , its early grandeur slowly but steadily fading into extinction . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject \" subscribe \" .",

[warning : the very nature of this review may involve plot spoilers for viewers who have not yet seen the film . ] of all the benefits i have received from being a film critic , i may value innocence the most . it may seem an odd choice of words in a profession more often associated with cynicism , but it applies nonetheless . while the onslaught of studio publicity is impossible to avoid completely , the ability to attend press screenings serves as something of a buffer against expectations . it was impossible for me to react to the blair witch hype since i had written my review six months before its release ; i never needed to guard against becoming aware of key crying game-esque plot points . it was possible for my viewing experience to remain relative untainted , subject only to pre-conceived notions for which i could have no one but myself to blame . it took the release of the sixth sense for me to realize how much that innocence can matter . reviews and discussions meticulously avoided revealing the specific nature of the ending , but by then the damage had been done . i considered everything i knew about the film , and made an educated guess regarding what would be revealed in its closing moments . then i finally caught up with the film , and watched with my \" can i out-guess the writer \" glasses on . within twenty minutes , it was obvious that i had guessed correctly . i'm not going to suggest that it was particularly clever of me to figure it out . i will suggest that i probably wouldn't have been testing my cleverness if i hadn't known there was something to be figured out . the simple knowledge that there was a plot point to be sussed out set me to sussing . and i spent as much of the film nodding to myself at the clues i recognized as i did trying to get caught up in the story . the nature of the film made such behavior both a blessing and a curse . writer/director m . night shyamalan's pacing is so agonizingly deliberate that i was delighted to have something else on which to train my attention . conversely , i was able to give bruce willis's monotonous performance a bit more benefit of the doubt , and admire the craft which allowed shyamalan's little trick to seem plausible . the only constant to draw me from my reverie was osment , a sublimely effective child actor whose performance alone is enough to recommend the sixth sense . children in jeopardy are usually a narrative cheat , but osment's reactions to his situation are always more compelling than shyamalan's few moments of thriller gimmickry . the irony is that my connection with cole's plight was consistently undercut by my awareness that the film's payoff would focus on someone else . perhaps my long-standing aversion to physician-heal-thyself psychologist/psychiatrist characters ( coincidentally sparked by another willis film , the ghastly color of night ) turned me off to malcolm as an equal player in the story . perhaps the supernaturally comforting closing shot reminded me too much of ghost . or perhaps i never bought the entire arc of malcolm's story from the outset . it's hard for me to know whether it was the film itself or my constant view of its wires which left me unimpressed . the success of the sixth sense suggests that it has struck an emotional chord in many viewers . for me , the only chords it could strike were technical . there was a not-particularly-inspired gag often used by titanic detractors during its theatrical run , something along the lines of \" what's the point , you know the boat's going to sink . \" most of the time , it's even true . next time , i hope i don't go into a film knowing whether or not the boat is going to sink . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject \" subscribe \" .",

            "message": "screenplay : andrew w . marlowe . director : paul verhoeven . mpaa rating : r ( violence , gore , profanity , nudity , adult themes ) running time : 114 minutes . hollow man follows in the fine tradition of james whale's 1933 version of the invisible man , in which claude rains loses his mind and goes on a murderous rampage . we understand this instinctively to be realistic because it's in the dna of every heterosexual adolescent male to define invisibility as the power to walk into the girls' locker room with impunity . hell yes we'd engage in a little mischief if no one could see us ; even the best of us might find it hard to resist the temptation . power corrupts , and so on and so forth . hollow man could have been a provocative examination of what that temptation would do to one of the best of us . the invisibility serum works on caine , but the reversal serum is not so successful , stranding caine in his invisible state . a bunch of techno-babble sets up the notion that the subjects of caine's serum are \" out of phase with the visible universe \" blah blah blah , and disappear from the outside in , one layer at a time . in fact , hollow man is awash in nifty visual tricks cleverly implemented : the thermal view of a full frontal bacon ; a scene of caine vomiting up invisible food in silent answer to that age-old question ; bacon's ghostly visage appearing in water , smoke and a tossed bag of blood . as effects-heavy thrillers go , this one at least makes every moment of technological gee-whizzery genuinely worth a gee-whiz . what it lacks , in essence , is anything that can be called a story . there's a vacant spot in the center of the film even before caine vanishes , because there's nothing remotely sympathetic about him from the outset . while we can still see him , he's an obnoxious sort who makes off-color jokes and mocks the vivisection of his lab animals . there's no character arc to sebastian caine ; hollow man merely presents the fairly self-evident answer to the question , \" what would happen if you granted omnipotence to a cruel , self-absorbed bastard with a god complex ? \" the script doesn't even give a character arc to its ostensible protagonist , shue's dr . mckay . perhaps she too could have been tempted , or learned something about scientific hubris . ultimately , it's nothing but a technically proficient mad slasher movie . make that a fairly diverting , technically proficient mad slasher movie , at least during its high-energy third act . the film turns from a gloss on cronenberg's the fly to a gloss on both alien and aliens ( though i actually enjoyed the nod to westworld , with josh brolin following in papa james' footsteps in a cat-and-mouse game involving thermal perception ) . the final 20 minutes becomes a frantic and generally entertaining hack-n-slash through the supporting cast members , leading up to an appropriately ridiculous climax . it's too bad verhoeven and screenwriter andrew w . marlowe weren't interested in putting some meat on hollow man's bones . even with all its visceral appeal , it could have been so much more interesting to watch the story of the guy who wants to walk into the girls' locker room with impunity , instead of the guy who wants to walk into the girls' locker room and blow it up . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject \" subscribe \" .",

            "message": "starring : guinevere turner , v . s . brodie , t . wendy mcmillan , anastasia sharp , migdalia melendez . screenplay : rose troche & guinevere turner . the problem with nearly every mainstream film dealing with lesbians is that they have been just so * serious * . if you believed what you saw on the screen , you'd think that every lesbian relationship involved a \" fallen \" heterosexual grappling in anguish with her sexual identity . even at their best , such \" love-that-dare-not-speak-its-name \" melodramas painted a picture that just didn't gibe the reality i have seen . what a breath of fresh air go fish is : a low-budget romantic comedy finally showing lesbians having fun and leading day-to-day lives . though uneven and amateurish enough to be occasionally distracting , go fish is mostly a frisky and funny pleasure , playing like a sort of when sally met sally . . . . go fish was a labor of love and a financial nightmare for turner and co-scripter/director rose troche , so it may seem unfair to criticize the erratic film quality and choppy editing . however , many of the rookie mistakes troche makes are difficult to pass off on economics . between scenes , she often inserts self-consciously artsy snippets of flashing lights , folded hands and spinning tops , and they just aren't in synch with the otherwise light-hearted film . it was as though troche wasn't sure she was ever going to get a chance to make a movie again , and thus threw every idea she had into this one , resulting in a somewhat scattered final product . troche is also at the mercy of her mostly non-professional cast , and they in turn are at the mercy of some occasionally very sketchy characters . the best role belongs to turner , an appealing presence with self-effacing humor . she delivers shome sharp lines with a wry wit , and anchors the scenes in which she , evy , daria and daria's amour-du-jour comment on max and ely's relationship . not so fortunate is v . s . brodie , who stumbles her way through a part written more through other characters observations than through anything ely says or does . while i have no problem with the idea that max might see past ely's unconventional looks , i would expect there to be a more interesting personality for her to find there . as underdeveloped as some of the characters might be , they still have plenty of funny things to say . in the film's opening scene , kia leads a class in speculating on what historical figures , celebrities , and even fictional characters might have been lesbians . the \" talking heads \" scenes are particularly entertaining , chief among them a discussion of preferred terms for the female genitalia . and in the film's sweetest and funniest moment , ely practically skips home after a particularly good evening with max . yet as amusing as go fish is , it is not without some frank observations on what it means to be a lesbian in the 1990's . go fish is not without its bumps and flaws , but it is both funny enough and insightful enough to warrant casting a line into its deep waters .",

            "message": "screenplay : david twohy . director : deran sarafian . most of the time , i see a new movie on its opening weekend , and it's not just so that my reviews can be fairly fresh . such was not the case with terminal velocity , which had the chance to accumulate a mountain of negative response in the two weeks between its opening and my screening . it's difficult to preduct how those pre-conceptions will affect my own reaction . in this case , they allowed me to be pleasantly surprised . terminal velocity is frenetic and uneven , but it has a certain bone-headed charm thanks to charlie sheen's improbably dense hero . sheen plays richard \" ditch \" brody , a skydiving instructor with something of a reckless streak . the plot of terminal velocity is not exactly what you would call inspired ; it's basically classic hitchcock crossed with classic james bond . the plot's few twists and turns are spelled out in huge letters from the outset , and a bit clumsy in the execution . equally distracting is a tone which careens from brutal to near slapstick in moments , making for a schizophrenic experience which isn't as purely enjoyable as it might be . director deran sarafian drives the action forward relentlessly , which is usually an ideal choice for a film of this genre , but often seems merely hyperactive here . terminal velocity sometimes feels like a cockroach race -- moving fast , but in no particular direction . its saving graces are the characterizations and interaction of charlie sheen and nastassja kinski . sheen's ditch brody is just a handful of brain celss removed from his goofball hot shots ! persona , but it's a character that comes off as extremely refreshing in an action thriller . rather than being either inordinately brilliant or dumber than virtually everyone in the audience , ditch is just simple . he is quite entertaining in scenes where he is infuriated by kinski's references to his dim-wittedness , but he maintains a kind of affable puppy-dog eagerness to please . it's a simple gesture , but funny because it's clear this is no rocket scientist we're dealing with . that rescue , a wildly inventive stunt , is certainly terminal velocity's highlight . it's a gag worthy of the best bond films , and it sends terminal velocity off on a note of high energy . but it's not an isolated moment . terminal velocity is full of well-staged action sequences , and twohy's dialogue is rich with fine one-liners . though it sometimes seems a bit too busy and scattershot for its own good , it's still a perfectly enjoyable no-brainer worth a few solid laughs .",

            "message": "is a light-hearted , quirky romantic romp about a date-from-hell . it most decidedly is not . it is a dark , disturbing and almost painfully honest character study which will have many viewers shifting uncomfortably in their chairs . the sensational performances of karen sillas and tom noonan should have added up to a sensational film , but they don't quite . in adapting his two person stage play , noonan manages both to under-direct and to over-direct , sacrificing much of the story's potential entertainment value for a more serious tone which simply doesn't ring quite as true . the first half of what happened was . . . , which establishes the characters through the mundane , is by far its most effective . it's a beautiful and sensitive performance , and jackie's genuineness provides a perfect counterpoint to michael's intellectual reserve , as he tries to maintain the upper hand through sarcasm without even knowing it . it soon becomes clear that jackie is far more perceptive than michael , and as the power dynamic shifts , michael crumbles . the development of this shift through the dinner is fascinating , if almost too understated . however , noonan is not content to deliver a sort of my dinner date with andre , and it is when the script takes an abrupt left turn into psychodrama that the film falters . noonan simply takes the scene too far ; children's voices whisper in the background , the camera shoots through the windows of a dollhouse , and sillas is lit with flickering candles like a voodoo priestess . the self-conscious arsty-ness of noonan's direction takes a serious scene and makes it almost a self-parody . michael's big breakdown is also played far too broadly . eventually begins too feel extremely scripted , losing the pinpoint honesty which had been its strength . is that it is much more interesting when its observations about human interaction are inspiring nervous laughter than when they are supposed to be inspiring serious contemplation . stories based on big emotional confrontations between characters are tricky to transfer from the stage to the screen . noonan only got it half right .",

            "message": "starring : kurt russell , james spader , jaye davidson . director : roland emmerich . stargate is a movie from out of a time warp , and i'm not just talking about the plot . stargate feels a lot like many of those films : overblown , underwritten , yet still moderately entertaining . perhaps it was the sense of nostalgia it inspired in me , but stargate offered just enough to keep me interested , despite all of its bombast and unfulfilled promise . for the first half hour , stargate seems to be pretty comfortably on the right track , with a solid premise . spader in particular is quite appealing , playing the perfect slightly dazed academic ; the early scenes in which he shows up the military scientists are low-key and quite a lot of fun . in fact , for all its $50 million scale , spader may be the best thing stargate has going for it . unfortunately , he makes kurt russell look like a large piece of plywood by comparison . as such he fits right in with the rest of the advance team , an interchangeable collection of macho grunts . once we get to the other side of the stargate , things are still wildly uneven , and we're not even talking about those plausibility questions that plague most science fiction fare . the real issue is that as good as stargate looks , it's awfully slow-moving . the sets and costume design are impressive , and even the desert sandscapes have a certain beauty to them . but stargate falls victim to its attempts at creating a fully-realized alternative civilization . it's a nice touch that they don't speak the \" miracle english \" common to alien civilizations , but it makes the soldiers' interactions with them extremely tedious . the fascination of some of the younger ones with the human aliens is believable , but a scene involving one of them reacting to kurt russell's lighter as magic is as old as the hills . it's as though director and co-scripter roland emmerich paid so much attention to cultural detail that he missed the big picture--providing a truly engaging story . the climax of stargate is a major improvement , full of energy and creativity . it's a shame that jaye davidson's ra is such a boring villain , gliding along through the ship making imperious pronouncements in a voice bearing a frightening similarity to that of jabba the hut . there is really very little in ra's role except ordering guards around , so the threat isn't nearly as threatening as it might be . the bottom line , though , is that even as i was thinking about how ridiculous some of the resolutions were ( including final decisions made by both russell's and spader's characters ) , i realized that i had enjoyed myself . and for a matinee price , i generally don't ask for much more .",

            "message": "every time a film based on actual events or including real historical figures appears , it seems that there are scholars stepping over each other to decry its lack of faithfulness to historical fact . whether it's shoeless joe jackson batting right handed in field of dreams , or the condensed time line in the recent quiz show , or any of a hundred other possible examples , there seems to be a widespread refusal to allow film dramas to be exactly that : dramatizations of real events , no more documentary than the re-creations on \" america's most wanted . \" as a moviegoer , my only question is , \" does it succeed as drama ? \" the answer for immortal beloved is that while it is sometimes quite enjoyable , it is better experienced than analyzed . perhaps the best , if most precious , way to describe immortal beloved is as ludwig von-adeus . writer/director rose has mounted a sumptuous production , gloriously scored with the subject's compositions and intended to bring some humanity to a figure most often seen as a wildly coiffed bust on a marble pedestal . and he manages to deliver some marvelous sequences : the sea of mourners greeting beethoven's casket ; his deafness revealed to an audience as he attempts to conduct an orchestra ; the beautifully staged premiere of the 9th symphony , as the \" ode to joy \" accompanies flashbacks to beethoven's difficult childhood . rose manages to wed sound to image in that manner that is uniquely cinematic , evocative without ever lapsing into pretentiousness . as successful as immortal beloved is as a sensory experience , it is not nearly as successful at establishing character . for better or worse , amadeus managed to make mozart a character we could relate to ; immortal beloved does not quite manage that feat with beethoven . but the fragmented nature of the narrative allows us only unsatisfying glimpses of the man beethoven might have been , and even rose's tendency to film oldman in medium and long shots contributes to this distancing effect . rose's choice of the \" immortal beloved \" letter might have seemed perfect as a jumping off point for examining beethoven as a character , but too often it just doesn't work . when the film stops dead for schindler to talk to one woman or another about beethoven , we expect some insight , and there just isn't all that much . though i have focused on many of immortal beloved's failings , i should make it clear that on the whole , i enjoyed it , particularly in the moment i was watching it . music coordinator georg solti fills the theater with grand music , and those scenes which simply feature music accompanying rose's images are quite powerful . but afterwards , i realized what that made immortal beloved : a somewhat ineffectual plot connecting some exceedingly well-made music videos .",

            "message": "forces of nature ( dreamworks ) starring : sandra bullock , ben affleck , maura tierney , steve zahn , blythe danner , ronny cox , stephen schiff . screenplay : marc lawrence . producers : susan arnold , donna arkoff roth and ian bryce . director : bronwen hughes . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , drug use ) running time : 105 minutes . i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool . i spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage , grousing to myself about its transparently planes , trains and automobiles plot machinations , and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement . this was a mass market romantic comedy , after all , a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and , even in its best days , worked hard to perpetuate the romance = infatuation paradigm . then marc lawrence did something wonderful , something which made the entire film click into place : he showed me a comic love story about grown-ups . forces of nature gets off to a solid enough start , setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue . sandra bullock , for her part , is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half-dozen films combined , avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping . the two performances -- part of a great top-to-bottom cast -- are effective and connected from the start , yet the script's apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely . lively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis , forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self-justification . the kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose , leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution . forces of nature isn't about a man developing a fear of commitment ; it's about a man learning what commitment means _to him_ , learning that it's not what he thought it was . lawrence's script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending , an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense . earlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance , and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine . though one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film , and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples , forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that you'll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom . that is , provided you're not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes . for a brisk romantic comedy , forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over-directed scenes of the year : teetering hand-held shots , why-not low or high angles , sweeping pans . occasionally the hyper-real approach works , with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance ; far more often , hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is , covering it with flourishes so thick you almost can't find what's underneath . a script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director , but even hughes' excesses can't spoil this unique concoction . forces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant , something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject \" subscribe \" .",

            "message": "perspective is a curious matter . sometimes , a thing is entirely how you look at it rather than the thing itself . even in the mind , style can triumph over substance . there is an abundance of style on display in three seasons , enough to cloak its lapses in substance . the narrative consists of four largely independent stories of life in modern saigon . visually , three seasons is a remarkably assured piece of film-making , using the contrasts of ancient , war-time and modern vietnam to perfection . cinematographer lisa rinzler captures flower-showered streets and lotus gardens with a warm glow , helping make three seasons an often enchanting tone poem on the conflicts inherent in introducing the contemporary into the conventional . as a narrative , it's considerably more inconsistent , as one might expect from the multiple independent story-lines . by far the most effective is the tale of cyclo driver hai , given the strongest emotional and thematic pull by don duong's exceptional performance . at its core his is a tried-and-true hooker with a heart of gold story , yet something in duong's manner makes the cliche more resonant , his attempts to \" save \" lan more ennobling than predictable . each of the other tales has its moments , but they come more sporadically . keitel's american perspective feels particularly intrusive , almost like a sop to american audiences ; what's more , it adds a title-confounding fourth story to the three seasons . though three seasons rarely inspires seat-shifting , it's never as engaging as it is when the focus is on hai . still , the stories do ultimately come together as tales of healing , of reconciling vietnam's troubled past with its challenging present and future . as the first american production shot in vietnam since the war , it's also an often-compelling cultural document . there's little doubt that three seasons feels somehow more \" significant \" because it is so gracefully and beautifully composed , but that's hardly a cause for consternation . if it pushes plenty of the right aesthetic buttons , that only proves that glamour can change one's perspective , as it clearly has in a post-war saigon where coke adds life . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject \" subscribe \" .",

            "message": "perhaps most significantly , american beauty became a critical and popular success with its cynical take on the facade of suburban bliss . it doesn't take long for a film's entire context to change . could judy berlin avoid feeling instantly , jarringly out-of-step ? in the case of judy berlin , such concerns probably seem silly , since its style is already so surreal and timeless . if judy berlin looks and plays like a suburban spin on a woody allen ensemble comedy , it shouldn't be surprising ; mendelsohn spent years as an assistant costume designer for allen films . essentially it's a character study , exploring the submerged longings of its suburban denizens that come to the surface only when the eclipse causes time to stand still . the veteran cast members deliver some superb performances , particularly kahn in a very funny yet very sad piece of work , and barrie as the not-well-liked teacher with an unknown inner life . judy berlin manages to hit some effective comic notes while always staying true to the small , very personal desires of even its peripheral characters . mendelsohn's main characters , however , fare less well . the title of the film tells us to focus on the interaction between david and judy as the thematic center , and , unfortunately , the center doesn't hold . david exists primarily as a stand-in for the filmmaker -- the frequent , nudgy references to the fact that we're watching a story that's going to be turned into a film don't help matters -- and hornick doesn't do enough with what is there . it's a very entertaining performance as an endearing character , but judy is more a symbol of possible escape than a fully-realized person . while david's mopey self-loathing may ultimately come in for affectionate mockery , that doesn't make it any easier to latch on to him as a protagonist , or to care about the fate of david and judy's relationship . even when he fumbles one of his sub-plots , mendelsohn keeps judy berlin enough on the sweet side of bittersweet that it remains appealing . the look ( jeffrey seckendorf's black-and-white cinematography ) and sound ( michael nicholas's piano and harpsichord score ) may contribute much to judy berlin's sense of timelessness , but the story itself plays a significant role . the characters in the film spend much of the running in place because they're always looking behind them . how refreshing to find a film that suggests there's something to look forward to -- even in the suburbs . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject \" subscribe \" .",

            "message": "or it's a huge , sick joke at the audience's expense . or maybe it's both . you can't really put any motivation past lars von trier , a director whose fondness for rendering his own name in block letters four times larger than the film's title belies a certain streak of ego . this is a man who decided to write the rules for a new aesthetic of minimalist cinema with his dogme '95 manifesto , then proceeded to break all those rules by making a live-action musical . it has become clear that you can predict virtually nothing about the way von trier will try to make a movie , except that it will inspire extreme emotions . you may want to gasp , or cry , or smack him silly for dragging you along on his exercises in self-indulgence . only musicals can temporarily distract selma from her mission -- watching one in a movie theater , performing in one in a local theatrical production , or imagining that the world around her is turning into one when life gets particularly grim . the grimness of selma's life is rendered in von trier's favored washed-out morph of film and digital video -- big risk #1 -- but it's a tactical blunder for this particular script . dancer in the dark is fashioned as a melodrama , with developments that pit our morally pure heroine against dastardly forces . on glossy celluloid , such an old-fashioned narrative approach might have worked . the hand-held , documentary-style of dancer in the dark , however , demands a level of depth in the characters' motivations and relationships that isn't always there . that's time that could have been much better spent on the underdeveloped relationship between selma and gene , which should be central to the film . it would have been possible to turn selma's conflicted motivations into a compelling plot point . instead , it's still often dizzying , chilling and more engrossing than virtually any other film this year . big risk #2 was the casting of bjork as selma , and it's hard to do justice to how extraordinary her performance is . while her less-than-authentic czech accent occasionally distracts , she hits every emotional note with such resonance that it's painful to watch her . and as painful as it is to watch , it's equally impossible not to watch when big risk #3 -- the musical production numbers -- kicks in . they're rendered as brightly-colored interpretations of selma's interior life , inspired by the natural rhythms of a train's wheels , machinery and a record's run-out groove . undoubtedly some viewers will find it impossible to get past the contrivance , or past bjork's distinctive yodeling vocals . others will be transfixed by the image of a killer fantasizing the forgiveness of the victim , or the most abruptly concluded musical number in film history . many critics have already noted that dancer in the dark bears more than a passing resemblance to von trier's 1996 film breaking the waves in its focus on the trials of a beatific female martyr . indeed , selma's sacrifice is not set up nearly so convincingly as that of emily watson's bess , which can only make dancer seem to suffer by comparison . that doesn't diminish what von trier is able to accomplish this time around with another spectacular performance and more giddy disregard for expectations and conventions . dancer in the dark is a deeply flawed narrative that becomes a long sit during its third act ; it's also studded with several moments of jaw-dropping brilliance . it's the work of a director who'll do anything to inspire a reaction . in a world of overly sanitized cinema , it's hard to dismiss that kind of raw nerve . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject \" subscribe \" .",

            "message": "since time immemorial -- memorial day 1996 , to be precise -- one question has plagued movie-goers the world over : what might mission : impossible have looked like if someone had shown the faintest interest in telling a coherent story ? as answer , i give you ronin , an international espionage thriller fueled by as much brain power as adrenaline . the comparison to mission : impossible is almost too easy , especially given the presence of jean reno in both casts , but it's a telling comparison nonetheless . ronin shows how much more effective a film can be when set pieces are connected by ideas . as the operation begins , alliances quickly shift with the prevailing winds , no lofty ideal more important than the exigencies of the moment . that notion both drives the film and provides its title . mission : impossible flirted with the same concept , but it was to turn characters into vengeance-driven super-villains . the characters are sketched in only the most basic terms , in keeping with their private natures , yet they are given presence by actors like deniro and reno bringing mournful weight to their performances . though few words are spoken in the script by j . d . zeik and richard weisz ( a . k . a . david mamet ) , the very lack of human interaction between the characters speaks volumes . for a fairly introspective film , ronin is also a fairly exciting one . director john frankenheimer goes to the car chase well perhaps once too often , but those he uses are tense and well-constructed . the action level is as high in ronin as it has been in any summer blockbuster of the last few years , and it's _better_ action , more white-knuckle gripping than whoop-it-up flashy . for some viewers , that may be reason enough to spend two hours at the movies , but it's all the more impressive because the action serves the story . every subsequent violent encounter raises the stakes in this chaotic world , while it's always clear that the combatants neither know nor care what they're fighting for . ronin certainly has its share of jagged edges , notably the aforementioned opening titles and a distracting romantic sub-plot between deniro and mcelhone . some may find the characters too remote and under-developed , and consequently find it difficult to invest emotionally in the story . i found the chilly isolation of the characters exactly what ineeded to become emotionally invested ; the emptiness of their lives and actions _is_ the hook . this isn't earth-shaking profundity we're talking about , merely the building blocks of effective drama -- the visceral coupled with the intellectual , actions with consequences . consequences were never really an issue in mission : impossible , which makes it that much easier to appreciate what ronin has to offer . it's no longer a james bond landscape of world domination . for once , evil in an espionage thriller isn't what people do , but why they do it . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line \" subscribe \" .",

            "message": "starring : kevin costner , clint eastwood , t . j . screenplay : john lee hancock . director : clint eastwood . let's face it , kevin costner hasn't become one of the most popular movie stars in the world because he can act the hell out of a part . sure , he's been charming enough in light fare like silverado and bull durham , but he's done little to prove that his ideal dramatic role wasn't as the corpse in the big chill . it therefore might not seem to mean much to say that a perfect world features costner's best all-around performance yet , and indeed it's nothing earth-shattering . however , it's more than solid , and coupled with an impressive turn by 7-year-old t . j . lowther creates a haunting story that packs a real punch even through its superfluous subplot . it seems in the early stages that he's setting up a parallel , or is interested in creating a hunter-hunted conflict a la the fugitive , but neither reall proves true . instead we get cliche'd characters in cliche'd conflicts . there's an icy fed to get on red's nerves , and plenty of pithy good ol' boy wisdom dispensed . eastwood and dern toss off token lines of good-natured antagonism , but neither one is interesting enough to make their story at all significant . a tighter , potentially classic drama might have come from chopping their segments entirely , because the main plot is a gem . the relationship between butch haynes and philip perry is one of the most unique and interesting explored in recent years . while at first glance butch might seem to be a simple \" victim of a negative environment \" type , he's more complicated than that . the picture that develops of his father is far from clear , making butch a less than reliable narrator . costner captures a surprising amount of nuance in his portrayal of butch , one minute the doting father , the next an edgy psychotic . it's a radical change of pace for costner , and he pulls it off . perhaps the larger credit for a perfect world's success is t . j . lowther . he's not asked to say much , but his expressive face becomes one of the most vital elements in the film . the relationship between butch and philip is the heart of a perfect world , and it's nearly perfectly executed . director eastwood's first outing since his oscar for unforgiven is a similarly dark piece about a struggle for redemption , and while the whole may not be as strong as last year's best picture winner , some of the moments are even better . the opening sequence is instantly gripping , and a long shot of butch and philip walking through a field , the boy repeatedly attempting to hold the criminal's hand , is wonderful . the best sequence comes near the end , as an idyllic waltz quickly turns into a remarkably intense confrontation . eastwood draws out the ending a bit too long , but by that point i was more than willing to stick with butch and philip . a perfect world is really two films . one is mediocre at best , but the other is one of the best films of the year . together , they still add up to one of the better films of the year . a note to inside joke watchers : look for a billboard for \" bull durham tobacco \" in the sequence at friendly's store .",

            "message": "i'm no marketing whiz , but it would appear that someone made a serious error in the advertising campaign for the new australian import sirens . one might be inclined to believe that the target audience is men , and that sirens is simply some soft-core porn throwaway . in fact , sirens has more in common with enchanted april than it does with emmanuelle . writer/director john duigan , creator of the wonderful coming-of-age films the year my voice broke and flirting , has fashioned another tale of sexual awakening , this time focusing on an adult , and it's a delightfully acted and beautifully filmed comedy-drama . sirens skillfully interweaves two themes without seeming overstuffed . that world is populated by wombats , insects and even flowers which take on a kind of personality . the characters native to this world are frequently shown eating apples , practically wallowing in their connection to original sin . lindsay challenges the christian notion of sin as linked to female sexuality , and sirens is largely the playing out of that challenge . at the same time , the issue of artistic censorship is very much part of the subtext . he presents the church's case with a respect for its views , and hugh grant is a charming and surprisingly hip spokesman . while the arguments are nothing special , and in fact tend towards the cliche , duigan treats the issue of art , its influence on the public and the artist's responsibility as a legitimate subject of debate . if there is any fault to be found with duigan's script , it's that he does skimp on his characters in the interest of establishing his analogy . the relationship between anthony and estella is not as well-established as it might be , and lindsay himself is little more than a catalyst for estella's transformation . macpherson and fischer look good , but they're given too much to say and it's never all that interesting when they do speak . however , sirens does quite a lot with its visuals , highlighting its glorious australian settings , and it maintains a frisky sense of humor about its sensual subject matter without sniggering over it . those who might be looking for a leering sex romp should look elsewhere ; sirens is lyrical , lively and thoughtful and always a feast for the senses .",

            "message": "screenplay : julian schnabel . director : julian schnabel . yes , i understand : happy artists do not exactly make for compelling drama . still , you have to admit that the cult of the tortured artist seems to have more adherents in hollywood than scientology . toulouse-lautrec in moulin rouge . . . tortured . so why is it that basquiat feels so completely unique ? perhaps it is because , for a change , its principal character is portrayed as a tortured human being first and foremost . this measured approach is surprising not just because write-director julian schnabel is a first-time film-maker , or because he was a friend of the film's subject , haitian-american artist jean-michel basquiat ( jeffrey wright ) , but because schnabel himself is an artist of no small renown . it has been a characteristic of the works of artists-turned-auteurs ( including andy warhol's and the ugly recent example of robert longo's johnny mnemonic ) that you could expect to find very little beyond the images . schnabel does create some extremely arresting images , including a sharp opening title sequence underscored by the pogues , but he has also left no doubt that this is a film about _someone_ , about some_thing_ . basquiat is a film full of vibrant characters , none more so than jean-michel basquiat himself . jeffrey wright , a tony award-winning stage actor , gives a stunning performance as basquiat , a lonely wraith who always seems to be hovering just on the edge of coherence . but schnabel also manages to show how absurdly easy art came to basquiat . indeed , when he is creating is the only time he does not seem to be suffering . it is also impressive that schnabel is savvy and confident enough to acknowledge the flaws of his own milieu , and the perceptions of the general public towards that milieu . the battle to represent basquiat is sometimes presented in melodramatic terms , with the artist forgetting the little people as he hits the big time , but schnabel doesn't gloss over the cult of personality of the art world . he adds the year's second superb portrayal of andy warhol , with david bowie perhaps providing even more clever detachment than jared harris's work in i shot andy warhol . watch also for a marvelous scene in which christopher walken plays a journalist interviewing basquiat , trying to bait him with subtle jabs at abstract modern art ; he speaks for everyone convinced that art is an elaborate con . there are a few clumsy moments in the structure of basquiat , notably the presentation of his relationship with another aspiring artist ( claire forlani ) , and the first half of the film is rather sluggishly paced . still , for a newcomer to film , julian schnabel is remarkably assured . basquiat is not about art as torture .",

            "message": "mpaa rating : not rated ( graphic depictions of corpses , profanity ) running time : 150 minutes . such are the vagaries of critical opinion , that temporal beast , that i found my experience of joe berlinger and bruce sinofsky's documentary both enhanced and diminished by recent pervasive coverage of high-profile murder cases . as a carefully constructed detective story , paradise lost is riveting ; as a study of small town america at its best and its worst , it is compelling . however , as an examination of publicly-aired grief and suspicion of the criminal justice system , it is merely exemplary rather than extraordinary . damien , an occult-fascinated , heavy metal-listening eccentric , is particularly tailor-made for prosecution , but there are potential problems with the case . there also happens to be virtually no physical evidence , and plenty to suggest that the crimes may have occurred somewhere beside the muddy ditch where the bodies were found . the first half hour of paradise lost introduces us to a fascinating cast of characters , and to a setting which is as critical to the case as any piece of evidence . hovering over the proceedings like a dark angel is the film's most enigmatic figure , damien echols -- a perceptive , self-absorbed and vaguely frightening young man who is like a satanist from central casting . the courtroom scenes are rife with the kind of confrontations familiar from both fictional and real-life proceedings , but the knowledge of its reality makes every unexpected revelation all the more enthralling . then new bits of evidence keep exploding like land mines . it is a case of such complexity that any amateur juror who has railed against noteworthy verdicts should be forced to watch paradise lost as a civics lesson . the courtroom drama of paradise lost is certainly intriguing , but i think the film spends a bit too much time in the courtroom , because the actual evidence is only half the story . outrage against the concept of presumed innocence just isn't news in this age , and paradise lost simply underlines this trend rather than exposing it . that is not to diminish its power -- paradise lost will have you asking yourself questions long after it ends . perhaps by the time i reach my own personal verdict , its power will have overwhelmed its familiarity entirely .",

            "message": "screenplay : kenneth branagh , based on the play by william shakespeare . director : kenneth branagh . kenneth branagh's hamlet is the first film version of shakespeare's revered tragedy to use the full , uncut text , and you know what that means : before you settle into your theater seat , smoke 'em if you got 'em , be sure to use the restroom , and bring extra quarters for parking . this hamlet is 238 minutes long -- 258 including the intermission -- making it one of the longest films ever produced for theatrical distribution . it is a terribly risky undertaking , but branagh has proven once again that the bard is safe in his hands . his hamlet does a remarkable job of demonstrating exactly how much is lost in edited versions of the play , re-vitalizing characterizations and offering a visual spectacle . it is a worthy challenger to laurence olivier's 1948 hamlet as the definitive film interpretation of the text . that bare bones synopsis cannot even begin to do justice to the complexity of hamlet , of course , but neither do many abbreviated film and stage versions . branagh's use of the entire text proves to be far more than a purist conceit , as he reveals additional layers of meaning . this hamlet is richer than any other you might have known because every piece of sub-text remains in the text . it is also a version which uses the unique opportunities of cinema better than any other . branagh has an instinct for excess in his film direction , but his dedication to shakespeare has anchored his adaptations of henry v and much ado about nothing where mary shelley's frankenstein and dead again occasionally got away from him . combining creative interpretive choices for the characters ( polonius [richard briers] becomes more malevolent and hypocritical as he is shown with a prostitute before sending someone to check up on laertes in france ) with superb technical credits ( tim harvey's dazzling production design and alex byrne's elegant , evocative 19th century costumes ) , branagh adds another thoroughly cinematic shakespeare to his resume . his direction may be nearly unimpeachable , but there are other areas where branagh's \" more is more \" philosophy are a hindrance . the casting of several familiar faces in minor roles feels more like a stunt than an artistic choice , and while crystal and charlton heston ( as the player king ) in particular are surprisingly effective in their roles , the effect is more often to turn hamlet into a hollywood sight-seeing tour : \" look , there's gerard depardieu ! look , there's robin williams ! \" branagh's lead performance is also distracting , and not because he makes poor character choices ( unless his bleached-blond hair counts ) ; the problem is that he is playing to the balcony even though he is on a movie screen . there may be one too many scenes in which spittle flies from the thin lips of his impassioned hamlet , and while branagh has a firm grasp of the dane's lighter side , his emoting is often forced . still , it is hard to come down too hard on a man who not only committed himself to the most challenging role in the history of theater , but directed an epic period production of the most challenging play in the history of theater . branagh took an exceptional gamble , and it paid off in an exceptional film . take a chance on spending 238 minutes to stretch your understanding of this remarkable play ; you can always stretch your legs during the intermission .",

            "message": "the american ad campaign for the film places jackie in a heroic pose in front of spandex-clad , gun-toting babes , a pre-opening credits sequence sets the stage with a few impressive stunts , and the opening credits themselves are full of silhouette images . anything sound familiar ? imagine , now , that in the course of mimicking one of the most iconic adventure series of the last thirty years , someone managed to improve on it . when the creative force behind the result is jackie chan , it's not a tremendous stretch of the imagination . operation condor is simply the most ridiculously entertaining action film to grace american screens this year , a dazzling combination of energetic comedy and virtuoso stunt work which shames the multi-million dollar detritus offered this summer by hollywood studios . and none of it really matters in the least , except to the extent that it provides a set-up for action sequences . that structure doesn't distinguish it much from most late-model bond films , or from the majority of late-model action films of any make . what does distinguish operation condor is the action it delivers -- not just big , loud and expensive action but inventive , thrilling and beautifully choreographed action . a jackie chan fight sequence can do something absolutely extraordinary in the jaded age of the blockbuster : it makes action seem original . you may spend half of operation condor's running time -- particularly the spectacular wind tunnel finale -- wearing the goofy expression of someone who can't believe he just saw that . you may spend the other half enjoying the presence of chan himself , though the bond analogy certainly breaks down at this point . chan is a lot of things on screen , but suave ain't one of them . you get the feeling you'd be more likely to see him in a cardigan and slippers than in an armani tuxedo ; he's like mr . rogers if he could do a spinning back kick . ( my apologies , fred , if you _can_ do a spinning back kick . ) yet it is exactly that polite , boyish charm which makes chan such a great action hero . he's in on the absurd joke of action films , but not in the raised eyebrow , quip-spewing way which passes for wit in other genre entries . chan is willing simply to laugh at himself , at the idea of a vulnerable nice guy who defeats his opponents with grace and style rather than with an uzi . there are a few clumsy transitions in operation condor , many the result of editing which trimmed almost twenty minutes from the original cut of armour of god ii , as well as predictably stiff supporting performances and grossly caricatured accents in the dubbed voices . operation condor is _fun_ , fun in a way which should make people embarrassed for using the same word to describe con air or the lost world . if i were pierce brosnan , i'd be looking over my shoulder right about now . chan . calling a critic 'elitist' is like calling an accountant 'mathist .

            "message": "screenplay : george welsh and peter jackson . director : peter jackson . earlier this year , i commented on thematically similar films where the later release suffered in comparison to the first . wyatt earp languished in the wake of the less reverent but far more entertaining tombstone ; blown away was blown away by the gleefully brainless speed . it was not a great film , but good enough that i wondered if my evaluation of heavenly creatures might be influenced . but where fun was occasionally stagy and ponderous , heavenly creatures is dazzling , a perversely original psychodrama . the strongest elements in fun were the performances of the two young lead actresses , and ironically the same elements provide the only minor weak link in heavenly creatures . melanie lynskey is the better of the two , playing the more complicated character , but it seems she settles into expressing every emotion by glowering beneath her nest of unruly dark curls ; kate winslet is occasionally a bit much , arching her eyebrows and punching her oh-so-proper upper crust diction . however , their scenes together are quite effective , and they show a natural rapport . lynskey in particular comes alive beautifully , and the intensity of their relationship never seems implausible . it is also illustrated with astonishing creativity by peter jackson , best known for the marvelously demented dead alive . from the first frames , jackson slams us into a world of chaos and delusion , and even through light-hearted scenes there is a sense of foreboding as we await the inevitable conclusion . this is the real triumph of heavenly creatures : although it is alternately a drama , a fantasy and a mystery , it is an absolutely coherent whole . because we know where this relationship will lead , there is an undercurrent of menace in dark-humored sequences where pauline visualizes revenge fantasies . it also presents the disturbing premise that given the right ( or wrong ) circumstances , the fantasy world every adolescent creates could explode into the real world . those circumstances involve a delicate issue , one also raised by fun . since there is a sexual element to the relationship between pauline and juliet , it would be possible to misinterpret the film as suggesting that their crime , leopold and loeb-like , was just another manifestation of their \" deviance . \" but jackson is up to something more subtle than that . through both his audacious direction and an insightful script , peter jackson has crafted a powerful character study that is unlike anything you'll see this year .",

            "message": "screenplay : leigh brackett and lawrence kasdan . director : irvin kirshner . mpaa rating : pg ( violence ) running time : 125 minutes . if pressed , i think most aficionados of the star wars trilogy would agree that the empire strikes back is the best of the three -- the best written , the best acted and the most skillfully constructed . however , it is not nearly as beloved as the original star wars , and though the newly released the empire strikes back : special edition is certain to be a success , it is unlikely to come close to inspiring the mania the return of star wars did on january 31st . so why will the same person who tells you to your face that empire is the better film only see it once this time around after seeing star wars two or three times ? the answers to that question -- and there are several -- are in some ways specific to this film . in other ways , they explain a lot about what people go to the movies to see , what they go to see _again_ , and why . what makes empire so extraordinary in retrospect is how many chances george lucas and his new crew -- director irvin kirshner and screenwriters lawrence kasdan and leigh brackett -- took when they had everything to lose by doing so . no image in star wars is as dark and creepy as luke's dream vision of his own face behind vader's mask , and obi-wan's vague homilies about the force in the original become yoda's extended lessons in an almost zen philosophy in empire . following a film which was the very definition of a crowd-pleaser , empire concluded with the good guys in disarray , one of them captured and another one crippled ( emotionally , if not ultimately physically ) . here was a blockbuster which had the audacity to mess with the most successful film formula anyone had yet discovered , a feature film which ended the way feature films just weren't supposed to end : with a cliff-hanger worthy of the old radio serials . those twists made the empire strikes back exciting and challenging in a way star wars wasn't , but they also made it a less satisfying movie-going experience . star wars ended with a victory for the heroes , a fanfare and a rousing ovation , allowing the audience to leave both entertained and with a basic sense of resolution . empire was not so generous . it took the simple good-vs . -evil the audience for a story set in that kind of world is smaller than the audience for a story set in star wars' morally bi-polar universe , and it's hard to imagine the empire strikes back would have been a success if it had been the first film to feature these same characters instead of star wars . the pure throw-back adventure of star wars was undemanding , but you were almost certain to leave the theater smiling , and ready to hop back on the ride again for yet another chance to come out smiling . meanwhile , the very complexity which made the empire strikes back a richer film also made it a film less likely to inspire multiple visits to the theater . after all , how many times did viewers want to be reminded that it was going to be another three years before they found out if darth vader was really . . . you fortunately , the special edition will inspire those who know star wars line for line to take a closer look at the empire strikes back , and it's not just what was there in 1980 which may impress them . there are fewer new touches than there were in the star wars : special edition , and those which are there -- a longer , more tense scene in which luke escapes a wampa on hoth ; enhanced footage of the arrival on cloud city -- are both less obtrusive and more useful . it is the sound , however , which is most spectacular in this new incarnation , an awesome demonstration of the kind of experience even a \" home theater \" can never possibly duplicate . the empire strikes back deserves its second theatrical life every bit as much as star wars , if not more , yet there were notably fewer people applauding at the end of empire . i'm not convinced that means the audience enjoyed it less ; i do think it means they will see it less . the amazing thing is that , in a cinematic economy where an unhappy ending is the kiss of death , george lucas dared to lure the star wars audience into a darker world at all .",

            "message": "it's pretty rare when a documentary gets a theatrical release . it's even more rare , about as frequent as sonny and cher reunions , when documentaries end up playing in multiplexes . but sure enough , i checked my local theater listings to discover that hoop dreams was playing not at one of the local \" art houses , \" but at the sixteen screen multiplex . if it means that more people will see this exceptional film , i'm all for it . hoop dreams is not just a film about basketball ; it is about as insightful a film about the american inner city experience as you will find , with more drama than a dozen fiction films . part of the tremendous appeal of hoop dreams comes from the fascinating cast of characters to which we are introduced . but for all its impressive scope , hoop dreams would not have worked had it only been about kids playing basketball . hoop dreams is thought-provoking , but it is also entertaining . it is not simply a great documentary ; it is one of the best films of any kind you will see this year .",

( actually , the fact that the movie was made in slovakia probably has something to do with the error . ) there's certainly nothing in here that's likely to jolt anyone , and even the typical , cheesy scares offered by low-budget horror flicks are ruined by pyun's heavy-handed direction . if anything , even at only seventy-five minutes in length , the movie is more apt to put viewers to sleep than keep them awake . the tired premise , which uses a recycled post-apocalyptic scenario , involves a bizarre psycho mutant killer on the loose in 2007 boston . of course , this is all background . this chase , which generates absolutely no tension , comprises the entire movie . there are no tangents , interesting variations , or anything else to break the monotony . in fact , there's not even much dialogue , and what little there is makes the tripe from sylvester stallone's daylight seem like shakespeare . attention to detail is not exactly adrenalin's forte , either . other characters are still around , alive and kicking , after getting riddled with about a dozen bullets . if i tried to list all the holes , inconsistencies , and other obvious problems with this movie , it would take me the rest of the week to write this review . a few words have to be said about this particular bizarre psycho mutant killer , who is perhaps the most lame bizarre psycho mutant killer ever to grace the big screen . this guy looks like quasimodo on a bad day . \" awful \" doesn't even begin to describe the makeup job ; disney's recent hunchback looked better , and he was a cartoon . of course , considering the intelligence ( or lack thereof ) of the characters we're exposed to , maybe that's not such a farfetched concept . i realize that aficionados of this genre don't expect much from their films , but adrenalin takes ineptness to new levels . christopher lambert fans ( are there such people ? ) natasha henstridge fans will probably be equally disappointed , since , unlike in species , she keeps all her clothes on . in fact , i'm hard-pressed to think of anyone who will appreciate this movie , unless it's someone who adores really , really bad movies . thus far , 1996 hasn't given us anything else that's in adrenalin's category . hands down , i nominate this as the worst movie of the year .",

            "message": "anyone following the behind-the-scenes history of even cowgirls get the blues knew that the film was in trouble long before its release . it didn't work . even cowgirls is as close to an unwatchable film as there is available at this time in the theaters . perhaps i might be more sympathetic had i read tom robbins' 1976 book - the \" first hippie novel \" , as van sant calls it - but i haven't , so i'll leave the comparisons to someone else . whether or not this is the 90s version of bonfire of the vanities remains to be seen , although cinematically , it's certainly on the same level . this provokes an armed federal response , and one of the most laughably idiotic denouements in recent film history . even if the plot made sense ( which it really doesn't ) and wasn't unbelievably contrived ( which it is ) , even cowgirls is difficult to follow because of its disjointed nature . whether this is a result of poor editing , confused writing , or ( most likely ) a combination of the two , the result is obvious - a chaotic motion picture that never finds its focus and is agonizing to sit through . sissy , the main character , is bland , although through no fault of uma thurman , whose performance is reasonably restrained in the midst of a festival of scenery-chomping . the problem with sissy is that van sant never forges a connection between her and the audience . there is no emotional link , and the viewer isn't likely to care any more about her at the end than at the beginning . with the notable exception of that given by thurman , the performances are awful . lorraine bracco ( who i don't consider to be a good actor ) and john hurt ( who i do ) go so far over the top that you wonder if they'll ever reach bottom . the dialogue , especially the tom robbins-supplied voiceovers , is grating . there's too much pretension and posturing here , and a typical conversation consists of characters trying to one-up each other in the number of meaningless profundities they can spew out . this is probably supposed to make the viewer ponder ; amidst all the other garbage that comprises even cowgirls , it just made me reel . the themes presented by the movie - feminism and the rights of the individual - have a heavy 70s flavor that van sant has done nothing to update . in a rare case of getting something right , at least even cowgirls gives a natural , non-exploitative view of lesbian love . then there are sissy's thumbs . every time sissy sticks out these monstrosities to hitch a ride , the viewer's eyes are glued to them - not because of some inner desire to gape at the deformity , but because they look so fake . further rumination on even cowgirls is probably as pointless as the film itself . the only possible reason to see it is to experience firsthand how badly a moderately-budgeted art film can go wrong . in some sense , it's hard to believe that this much talent can produce something so worthless . that's enough to give anyone the blues .",

            "message": "before i start lambasting this motion picture , let me recap my feelings about the french film upon which jungle 2 jungle is based . little indian , big city ( a . k . a . , un indien dans la ville ) was easily one of 1996's worst films -- a dull , lifeless attempt to cull laughs from dumb characters doing stupid things in contrived situations . not for one moment was it cute , funny , or likable . the predictable result is a bad movie -- the kind of pointless tripe that the mouse company continues to foist upon us in the name of \" family entertainment . \" when i first heard that allen was going to star in the little indian reworking , my reaction was that it couldn't possibly be worse than the original . ultimately , i was right , although just barely . jungle 2 jungle ( what a stupid title -- why use \" 2 \" instead of \" to \" ? ? ) is pretty close to unwatchable , and it's certainly neither entertaining nor enjoyable . it is slightly more energetic than little indian , and that's the only reason why i have given it a marginally better rating . crocodile dundee this ain't . everything in jungle 2 jungle is hackneyed . there's never a whiff of innovation or a hint that the film makers might be interested in trying something different . and , like all \" good \" family films these days , there are several obligatory flatulence jokes . neither of these aspects work . there's nothing emotionally solid or satisfying about the father/son relationship , and the duo's attempts at comedy seem more desperate than funny . the most amusing moment in jungle 2 jungle is entirely unintentional . during a scene when an incredibly fake spider is scurrying around the floor of michael's boss' office , you can see the strings being used to manipulate it . i for one am sick and tired of the unappealingly unoriginal fare that disney releases on a constant basis . it's getting to the point where a visit to the dentist sounds like a reasonable alternative to sitting through another plot-by-numbers family film from the studio of plastic characters and happy endings . at least this time they've managed to do something of dubious note : turn one of 1996's worst motion pictures into one of 1997's . congratulations , disney . i hope walt is turning in his grave .",

            "message": "much as i disliked ace ventura : pet detective , it pains me to admit that jim carrey's first star vehicle was better than this hopelessly unfunny followup . pet detective , while being exceptionally silly and dumb ( that , i suppose , was the whole point ) , still had its humorous moments . the same cannot be said of when nature calls , which , although equally moronic , left me sitting stone-faced in my seat for ninety minutes while it tried vainly to coax a laugh . there's nothing worse than a film which mistakenly believes it's the comic event of the year . for no legitimate reason whatsoever , when nature calls is full of itself to the point of being offensive . in the eyes of some fans , the rubber-faced carrey can do no wrong , and they will undoubtedly lap up when nature calls , then come back for seconds . this film was made for them . for the rest of us , who can endure the comedian only in small doses or when he's carefully reigned in ( as in the mask ) , the picture is virtually unwatchable . like cough medicine , the taste gets worse the more you're forced to ingest . when nature calls opens with an uninspired take-off of cliffhanger ( a movie that was almost a self-parody in its own right ) . of course , ace solves the case , but only after an inordinate number of idiotic jokes and failed sight gags . carrey's meteoric rise started with the first ace ventura , so it was certain there would be a sequel . what's so surprising is how creatively barren steve oedekerk's movie is . when nature calls relies solely on carrey's personality and performance to sustain it , which doesn't happen . the writing is sophomoric and the humor often makes dumb and dumber look enlightened . it's hard to imagine carrey doing something worse than when nature calls , but then i previously thought he'd have a hard time lowering himself below the standards set by pet detective . all things considered , that's an appropriate place to dump this latest installment of the ace ventura saga .",

( the film makers may have miscalculated here -- the crowd i was with laughed their way through the supposedly-taut climax . ) ( cinematographer doug milsome's glorious scenic shots are easily breakdown's highlight . ) but that's not the worst aspect of the situation -- jeff and amy think they're being stalked by another driver ( m . c . i have just described about the first thirty minutes of the movie , and it doesn't sound bad at all . take a little hitchcock , a dash of steven spielberg's duel , and a pinch of the vanishing , and you get a fair approximation of the level at which breakdown begins . that's a lofty perch to start from , which means that it's a long way down , and , unfortunately , breakdown plummets the entire distance . the ending has more in common with sloppy , cliched , psycho-killer thrillers like unlawful entry and benefit of the doubt ( the setting reminded here me of that one ) than with anything fashioned by a respectable director . the three leads -- kurt russell , j . t . walsh , and kathleen quinlan - - do the best they can with cardboard , one-dimensional roles , but the script's banality defeats them . of course , they can't be held entirely blameless for this debacle , since they agreed to appear in it . given his recent track record , which includes the white-knuckler executive decision , i would never have guessed that russell was so hard up for a job that he'd have to accept something of this sort . thrillers don't have to be realistic to work . take speed , for example . there's no way that the bus could have cleared the gap in the road . but we believed it because the movie had painstakingly created an \" alternative reality \" in which such gravity-defying feats were possible . breakdown never does that , and , as a result , its increasingly- preposterous turns come across as laughable . his pedestrian direction and unoriginal script diffuse any tension that breakdown might have generated . if this movie was a car , it would have been hauled off to the junk yard as soon as it started falling apart -- a process that is well underway by the half-way point .",

            "message": "unfortunately , perhaps because first time writer/director miguel arteta is attempting to tackle too many issues , or because he doesn't have a good feel for anything below the surface , much of this movie comes across as shallow and melodramatic . spain's stiff and unconvincing performance does little to draw us into his character's life and bring us face-to-face with his many dilemmas . while i can't think of another film that covers all of the ground traversed by star maps , the film frequently ventures into territory that was examined more effectively by such diverse offerings as my family , once were warriors , and johns . as a result , watching star maps is likely to generate a sense of deja vu . someone once said that all movies are basically copies of others , and , while it doesn't always seem that way , in this case it does . there's enough material in star maps to keep a soap opera going for several weeks , if not months . the characters are all drawn broadly , and the direction lacks subtlety ( the moment we see a bottle of pills being hidden behind some cans , we know it's going to be important later in the film ) . there are a pair of interesting personalities here -- carlos' sister , maria , and pepe's mistress , letti -- but neither is accorded enough screen time to do more than briefly arrest our attention . for the most part , the acting is amateurish , which is disappointing , although not surprising , considering the film's low budget . but , while the movie lacks strong performances , its greatest weakness is the writing . in trying to original , arteta inserts several offbeat comic sequences ( carlos accepting an oscar after an award-winning performance in bed , a bizarre dinner conversation ) that , while funny as stand-alone pieces , clash violently with the overriding tone . the ending is also problematic . while it's supposed to be ambiguous , it's actually frustrating , leaving all sorts of loose ends dangling . despite all of its flaws , however , star maps still has a soap opera-type appeal . it's not the kind of movie many people will walk out on , because , even considering its lack of depth , it retains the ability to hook a viewer into wondering what happens next . there's enough sex , violence , and boiling-point emotion to capture the attention of even the most easily-distracted viewer . ultimately , however , star maps doesn't amount to much more than several ideas that are never effectively translated into anything more potent than sudsy drivel . \" the cinema is not an art which films life : the cinema is something between art and life . unlike painting and literature , the cinema both gives to life and takes from it . . . \" - jean-luc godard",

            "message": "starring : miho nikaido , tenmei kano , sayoko amano director : ryu murakami producers : yoshitaka suzuki , tadanobu hirao , and yosuke nagata screenplay : ryu murakami music : ryuichi sakamoto released by northern arts entertainment japanese with english subtitles ai doesn't have the personality to be a prostitute . for someone mired in her situation , there don't seem to be any solutions . the problems illustrated in the movie are not unique to that country , however . decadence is a human condition , and where men and women are , there too will be the ugliness shown in this picture . those who feel that rising sun is guilty of japan-bashing may be very disturbed by the impressions presented by tokyo decadence . perhaps because it's made by japanese film makers primarily for a japanese-speaking audience , the producers felt no need to pull punches . writer/director ryu murakami's theme can be summarized in one sentence from the movie : \" it's japan that's wealthy , but it's wealth without pride . \" psychologists have always talked of how powerful men have a need to be dominated--murakami has applied this to the collective psyche of an entire country . the sex in this film , while abundant and explicit , is definitely not erotic . viewers are more likely to be sickened than titillated . murakami didn't make this film to tickle people's libidos ; he wanted to bring out the potential ugliness that can come through sex . in that , he has succeeded abundantly . tokyo decadence is graphic but not gratuitous , and i can't go into details about some of the humiliation that ai is put through without proof that the reader of this review is over eighteen . tokyo decadence is so bleak that without the inclusion of a brief scene designed primarily for comic relief , this would have been as close to unbearable a movie as i have ever seen . as is often true of cautionary tales , the stuff of tokyo decadence is too strong for mere entertainment . that having been said , there is still a story with characters . of all the people we meet , only ai attains depth , but she is brilliantly fleshed-out by the script and portrayed by actress miho nikaido , who has to put a lot of herself on the line to appear in some of tokyo decadence's scenes . few performers are willing to expose themselves to this much humiliation and degradation--even if it is only on film--to bring a character to life . for most of the movie , the plot is reasonable , if not overly-involving . often , movies conclude with let-downs , but in the case of tokyo decadence , there's a complete collapse . the last twenty minutes are so poorly put together that they're virtually not worth sitting through . the drawn-out finale is tedious , and seriously damaged my overall impression of the movie . five minutes would have been more than enough time to bang home murakami's final point . production-wise , the picture is a mixed bag . the musical score is poor , sounding like a badly-synthesized composition lifted directly from some cheap 1970s american flick . the cinematography is equally of dubious quality . in attempting to highlight the dispiriting nature of the film , many of the scenes were shot in conditions of low lighting . unfortunately , sometimes things are so dark that it's difficult to figure out what's going on . tokyo decadence is a movie that will appeal only to a select few . strong stomachs and a willingness to see almost anything are requisite . the movie is rated nc-17 for a reason . those who take a chance on this film may be disappointed by some of what it has to offer , but the overall experience won't soon be forgotten .",

            "message": "date released : 6/30/93 running length : 2 : 34 rated : r ( language , mature themes , sexual situations , violence ) john grisham's novel the firm is a furious page-turner , the kind of book that you don't want to put down once you've started reading it . the characters are well-rounded and developed in such a way that the reader cares about their fates . the fascinating setup ( roughly the first 100 pages ) is perhaps the novel's greatest strength and , even though the eventual resolution lacks punch , few would deny that the firm is an entertaining read . sydney pollack's film the firm is the kind of movie that almost anyone could walk out on without feeling that they've missed much , regardless of whether they've read the book or not . very little of what made the written version so enjoyable has made it to the screen and what we're left with instead is an overly-long ( two hours and thirty-four minutes , to be exact ) , pedantic thriller that , at best , can be described as average . that's a good idea , because the film the firm doesn't come close to reaching the level of intensity achieved by the novel of the same name . comparisons are inevitable , of course , but it isn't necessary to have read the written version to be disappointed by the visual adaptation . the plot is a good place to start the discussion . this was the book's weakest element and , if anything , it's worse in the movie . while the final \" twist \" to the movie's story ( which in no way resembles what happens in the novel ) is clever , it is also difficult to accept . is it reasonable to believe everything that happens in the pivotal climactic scenes ? i doubt it . while i applaud the screenwriters for coming up with a unique way to conclude the film , their inept execution of the concept causes the ending to seem cheap and contrived . the unfortunate tone of the movie is set during the first hour . the film spends quite a bit of time using short , often-disjointed scenes in an attempt to recapture the near-perfect mood of grisham's setup . this would have worked nicely if those various snippets had successfully conveyed the allure of the firm to mitch and abby , but things rush by so quickly and everything is so out-of-sync that the result is to make the first quarter of the movie long and tedious . there are many differences between motion picture and novel . with numerous expected , mostly-minor cuts and changes , the first half of the film stays reasonably close to its written counterpart . not all of the changes are bad--some , at least in their intent , are intriguing . unfortunately , the script writers appear not to have thought things through all the way--a fault that grisham's novel is rarely guilty of . not until the last act does he give anything resembling a feeling performance , managing to effectively sabotage mitch in the process . by the time things get interesting in the firm , we don't care what happens to the protagonist , because the actor playing him has failed to capture our sympathy . jeanne tripplehorn is worse , playing abby with as much enthusiasm and energy as a zombie . even as i was apathetic towards mitch because of cruise , i began to actively dislike abby as a result of tripplehorn's unimaginative performance . consider for a moment someone of emma thompson's caliber in this part and you'll want to break into tears of frustration . fortunately for the film , the supporting cast is uniformly strong . both of these actors steal many of the scenes that they're in . as impressive as these two , if not more so , is gene hackman's avery tolar . softened in the movie from his counterpart in the book , this avery becomes the only completely real--and sympathetic--character in the film . hackman's performance is more than half the reason why . in the hands of a lesser actor , avery could have become sappy , silly , or stupid , but not in this case . by the closing scenes of the firm , he was the only one i really cared about . i dislike bashing movies simply because they differ from the books that spawned them . the mediums of entertainment are different , after all , and should be treated as such . no film can do a perfect adaptation of a novel . putting aside the issue of its source , this is not a good movie . if there's a reason to go , and i don't think there is , it's to see gene hackman's performance . unfortunately , given his amount of screen time , there's a lot of other garbage that will have to be endured along the way . in the past , i've enjoyed many of syndey pollack's projects ( out of africa and tootsie in particular ) , but this film got derailed early and even this talented director proved unable to get it back on course . i suppose it's a difficult task to try to please both admirers of the novel and the casual movie-goer who has never read it . in attempting that , pollack has made a mess of everything--plot , characterization , and pacing . fans of john grisham's novel will see the firm regardless of what reviews it gets , so to them , and to others , i offer a cautionary warning to be wary . the firm had a lot of potential but the production team found numerous ways to mess it up . this isn't an awful film , nor is it unwatchable , but i'd think twice before spending time and money in a darkened theater with telling of mitch mcdeere's struggles .",

            "message": "mad city is one of innumerable motion pictures that gets derailed on the long track from premise to realization . the semi-serious film , which stars high-profile actors dustin hoffman and john travolta , and is directed by costa-gavras ( betrayed ) , becomes the latest in the recent flurry of movies to make a statement about the growing lack of ethics in broadcast journalism . it's all ratings and entertainment value , not integrity ! unlike some of the more worthy contenders , mad city fails to bring anything new to the table . every aspect of this movie has been presented before in a better film with a more involving setup . if you've seen network , to die for , welcome to sarajevo , and especially billy wilder's 1951 biting satire , the big carnival ( aka ace in the hole ) , mad city will seem like a tired retread . the absence of originality and inspiration isn't mad city's only problem -- it also suffers from a shocking lack of subtlety . the film's goal of skewering the media is pursued with such single-mindedness that nearly every supporting character is reduced to a familiar type : the empty-headed local news personality , the arrogant network anchor , the innocent camera person seduced by fame and fortune , and the old- fashioned news director who looks on sadly as the story is manipulated . even john travolta's sam baily isn't all that interesting -- he's basically a dumb lug who lets circumstances get away from him . mad city says everything it wants to say in its first forty-five minutes . after that , it spins its wheels for over an hour , waiting for the inevitable conclusion . despite costa-gavras' best manipulative efforts , sam never captures our sympathy . worse still , he's a static personality with no dramatic arc . he's the same at the end as at the beginning , and it's difficult for an audience to connect with an individual who exhibits no growth . travolta does an adequate job in this role , but he doesn't have a character of substance to work with . hoffman , who previously played the less jaded but equally energetic bernstein in all the president's men , is excellent as max , mad city's dubious moral compass . but , although hoffman gives max flair , there's little that he can do to correct the overlong and derivative script . none of the supporting actors really stands out with the possible exception of alan alda , who does a credible imitation of a snake in the grass . mad city's overall picture of the media is decidedly unflattering . the movie is also awash in subplots , none of which amount to much . in fact , they seem like filler to pad the movie out to its nearly two hour length . for a film that covers so much material , mad city seems surprisingly drawn out , but the reason is that it fails to do much of anything well . the satire isn't sharp and the drama isn't effective . watching mad city , i felt much the same way that i did 5 years ago while sitting through hoffman's hero -- great idea , poor execution . mad city doesn't work because it's an exercise in themes and ideas that never gels into a compelling story . \" for me , the cinema is not a slice of life , but a piece of cake . \"",

            "message": "the pelican brief is the second john grisham novel to make the book-to-movie transition . like its predecessor the firm , it disappoints , which isn't such a big surprise considering the pedestrian story upon which it is based . instead of wondering why grisham's work doesn't translate well to the screen , maybe someone should take a step back and consider whether his page-turners are worth filming in the first place . naturally , this makes grantham as much of a target as darby , and the pair end up on the run . in the book the pelican brief , the particulars are different from those of the firm , but the basic premise is very similar . that's all right , and it makes for quick , brainless reading , but neither of the movie versions has worked . paradoxically , the firm's biggest failing is in straying too far from the written version while the pelican brief's flaw is in remaining too faithful . as scripted and directed by alan j . pakula , the pelican brief is a straightforward visual re-telling of grisham's book . with few changes , it follows the basic storyline , and includes a number of complications and secondary characters which seem superfluous on screen . the final result is an unnecessarily-long thriller that contains far more talking than action . pakula's direction is lackluster , showing little of the style that permeated his two most impressive pictures , all the president's men and presumed innocent . character depth and development are virtually nonexistent . grisham's book isn't a tremendous achievement in this area , but at least we get some insight into what various people are thinking . with that element absent in the movie , no one attains more than a two-dimensional status , and much of the entertaining in-fighting and political wrangling is lost to the viewer . john heard's gavin verheek is a perfect example . the supporting cast is impressive , with names like robert culp , john heard , sam shepard , and john lithgow all turning in solid performances . this may be the only film character to approach the level of the book version , and much of it can be credited to mr . washington's work . ms . roberts simply doesn't have the range required for the role , as becomes painfully obvious when she's supposed to express terror at a car bombing . that particular scene , as well as several others requiring deep emotional responses , presents a fair approximation of her acting limitations . one of the reasons for the failure of the basic premise in the pelican brief--that darby could uncover the truth while everyone else fumbles around--is that the lead actress does nothing to make us believe the possibility . ultimately , probably the biggest problem with the pelican brief is that it's a letdown . after all the running around ( and there's a lot of that ) , all the gory deaths ( there are a few of them ) , and all the anemic plot twists , the payoff is virtually nonexistent . instead of the rousing conclusion expected from a screen thriller , the pelican brief fades away into an anticlimax . those who read the book have no need to see the movie , unless it's to satisfy the curiosity of how the conjurations of the imagination materialize through the filter of pakula's interpretation . those who haven't read the book will find material to catch their interest , but it's uncertain how long this ill-paced production will hold that attention . so , after the disappointments of the firm and the pelican brief , we now await the cinematic rendition of the client , hoping that for grisham's books , the third time will be a charm .",

            "message": "first of all , let's get the obvious question out of the way . however , while moore's body may be the movie's primary selling point , the film tries to do more than just display naked breasts . the heart of striptease is a satirical examination of those who frequent strip clubs , and this makes it profoundly different from showgirls , which embraced those aspects of american culture that striptease lampoons . unfortunately , striptease's satirical bent , while aimed not only at the sexist attitudes of those who patronize topless joints , but at politicians , right-wing religious fanatics , and lawyers , is unfocused and lacks the requisite viciousness . it's just one aspect of a muddled , overly-long motion picture that can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama . ultimately , the overabundance of ineffective dramatic moments hurts the movie . the situation is just too improbable and silly to carry any dramatic weight . one of the supposed comic elements of striptease is burt reynolds' offensive , fatuous character . this is an unsavory man , and reynolds plays him in a creepy , unsettling manner . but , if it's difficult to laugh at reynolds , the same can't be said about ving rhames . in his role as shad , the eager beaver's bouncer , rhames' deadpan , matter-of-fact style ( similar to the one he used in pulp fiction ) is consistently hilarious . moore is fine in this role , although more attention will be paid to her physical attributes than her acting . she's a little out of her depth in the dramatic sequences , although that's only one of the reasons they don't work ( the script being the primary culprit ) . young rumer willis , who received a lot of notoriety before she was born as a result of moore's vanity fair cover , displays some promise with her unaffected performance . despite being designed to mock those who leer , striptease does some leering of its own . several lengthy topless dance sequences are shot in an energetic and provocative manner . it's easy to be cynical about this film's motives , especially considering how drastically andrew bergman's script has watered down the most biting aspects of carl hiaasen's novel . striptease is a curious mix of eroticism , comedy , and drama that , instead of blending into a pleasing whole , has a tendency to separate and curdle .",

            "message": "to me , the idea of a sequel to the fugitive always seemed like a bad idea . as re-invented here , girard is a generic action hero ; most of the quirks that made him interesting ( and that earned jones an oscar ) are absent . with a few minor re- writes , john mcclane from the die hard movies could have been plugged into this role . the script tries to recapture the energy of the fugitive by re- cycling various plot elements . unfortunately , it's not just one chase -- it's one after another after another . the repetitiveness quickly grows tiresome , and the movie ends up lasting at least thirty minutes too long . the bloated running length has nothing to do with extra time needed to unravel the needlessly convoluted plot . it simply offers an opportunity for the characters to do a lot more running around before the final , inevitable confrontation between girard , sheridan , and a traitor ( whose identity , despite being easy to guess , shall remain unrevealed here ) . snipes' sheridan appears to have undergone a personality extraction -- there's nothing deeper than the bare-bones \" innocent guy on the run . \" most of the supporting characters are equally faceless , with the exception of joe pantoliano's cosmo , who acts like he drinks too much coffee . while i enjoyed the fugitive , i wasn't the film's biggest booster . i thought the coincidence-laden plot was poorly constructed . but the action sequences were often nail-biters , the lead characters were well- developed , and the dialogue was intelligent . u . s . marshals exhibits many of the fugitive's faults with few of its strengths . as a result , this movie is a routine exercise in stunt choreography , with more valleys than peaks , and not enough tension to keep the viewer engaged for the full 143-minute length . u . s . marshals is workmanlike , and that makes it , at best , a marginal choice for theatrical viewing . \" my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . \" -- david puttnam",

            "message": "the first thing to notice about john duigan's lawn dogs is the astounding performance of newcomer mischa barton , who plays devon , the 10-year old protagonist . barton is a natural actress , and manages to convey the perfect blend of maturity and innocence necessary for us to accept her character as something more vital than the construct of an uneven plot . theirs is basically a friendship between outsiders , and , although there is an undeniable sexual undercurrent inherent in their interaction , it's kept subtle , and duigan never exploits it . this is no lolita ; these two have a great deal in common on an emotional level , but neither is interested in entering into a physical relationship . sadly , barton's standout performance and the core relationship are really the only two worthwhile aspects of lawn dogs , a film that never quite gels into a satisfying whole . the problem is twofold . the plot is unwieldy and peppered with familiar , melodramatic moments . worse , the supporting characters are all pure caricatures . the plentiful attempts at satirizing the suburban lifestyle consistently strike a wrong note , often seeming cruel , uncomfortable , or out-of-synch . all other elements of the film are disappointingly banal . sitting through lawn dogs is like watching two entwined movies of vastly different quality . one is a well-written , atypical buddy story . the film expends enough effort on the latter to mute the impact of the former , and the climactic sequence is an exercise in violent , predictable melodrama . while there are things to appreciate in lawn dogs , especially barton's performance , the film as a whole left me strangely unfulfilled . \" my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . \" -- david puttnam",

            "message": "tie me down ! ) never does anything in a conventional manner , and kika is no exception . a black farce on sex , violence , and the attraction held by both for the general public , kika is one of those films that causes the mpaa to get nervous . as a result , this admittedly explicit motion picture was given an nc-17 . the real problem with kika is that , while it's moderately entertaining and occasionally riotously funny , one of the first thoughts after leaving the theater is likely to be along the lines of \" what was the point of that ? \" as a satirical social commentary , the film is surprisingly shallow , not to mention insensitive . it's easy to see how some viewers could be offended by the cavalier , jokey manner in which rape and incest are portrayed . the plum role belongs to victoria abril , portraying a \" journalist \" who makes geraldo rivera look like a serious tv newsman . with a camera mounted atop some sort of futuristic-looking headgear , she goes from crime scene to crime scene , hoping to catch a murder or something equally as juicy . this satire on tabloid tv and the public's fascination with it is done with scalding insight and an indifference to political correctness . almodovar has never worried about being accused of going too far , and the viewer's reaction to kika may reflect how much distance along this path they're willing to go with the writer/director . the title character is a bit flighty , and more than a little afraid of a commitment . for the first two-thirds of the movie , kika lies at the center of everything that's going on . removing the main character from the climax is a strange way to structure a movie . kika is too long , and the ending doesn't fit well with the much-better first half . by trying to tie all the disparate themes and storylines together at the end , almodovar creates a chaotic mess that is never successfully untangled . there are a number of dead bodies , but no real sense of closure . there's no doubt that kika does exactly what almodovar intended it to . from its moments of inspired comedy to its descent into bad taste , the director's indelible signature is woven into the fabric of the film . this movie is likely to offend as many as it appeals to , and i felt a little of the pull in both directions . ultimately , however , almodovar's central parody is strong enough to save this film from floundering too much or too often . it's daring and nasty , but rarely brilliant .",

( \" say it ain't so , joe ! \" ) with so many players off to fight , however , the talent was thin . the mets had the worst initial season of any 20th century baseball team . baseball's most glaring fault is that it's too long . much too long . certain segments seem to drag interminably with little in the way of color added to the basic historical regurgitation . most of what this series has to offer can be gleaned from a good book on the sport . the analysis is rarely penetrating and the visual elements are typically stale . the moments when baseball shines are too often sandwiched around stretches of dry , straightforward documentary presentation . almost equally disappointing is the film's treatment of the modern era . burns' examination of the '70s and '80s is a spotty , hit-and-miss affair that creates few memorable impressions . baseball is at its strongest when it focuses on one of its three primary themes . the film demonstrates the elasticity of the game's appeal , and you get a sense that no matter how immediately crippling the current players' strike is , the sport will eventually overcome it . the examination of baseball's approach to segregation ( before the mid-'40s ) and integration ( thereafter ) is handled in a thought-provoking and thorough manner . burns' probing of the role of blacks in the sport--both in the negro leagues and later in the major leagues--represents one of the most insightful filmed approaches to the subject . inexplicably , however , the work stoppages of the '70s and '80s are not mentioned . fans in other parts of the country may at times feel slighted , however . and boston , other than being burns' favorite team , is hardly worthy of the amount of exposure it receives . based on relative screen time , one would have to conclude that casey stengel was a more important figure than connie mack , and yogi berra was of greater significance than steve carlton , lou brock , and mike schmidt combined . burns' civil war style of combining photographs with \" talking heads , \" period music , and voiceover quotes doesn't work as well in baseball , perhaps because the emotional resonance achieved here doesn't match that of stories of a nation torn by war . by the middle of the series , film clips are replacing still photographs , making this documentary's overall format seem more traditional than that of its predecessor . the are several noteworthy \" recreations \" of partial or entire games . in the end , a non-baseball fan who sticks with this movie for its entirety is likely to learn a lot about the sport and its history , and perhaps gain an understanding of why it inspires such passion in so many people . and every viewer , devotee or not , is herein given the opportunity to appreciate the unique synergy between the progress of the game and american history . baseball is a canvas painted with broad strokes and little detail . burns has invested an incredible amount of effort and passion into a project that is by turns insightful , nostalgic , pedantic , and ( unfortunately ) occasionally dull . \" i actually think [baseball] still is at the center of our lives in this country . oh , it has periods when it seems to be eclipsed . but baseball has so inserted itself into the american soul . its strength is uniting people , generation after generation . it's suffering from an anxiety about itself . and you know what ? knowing your own history is the best antidote to that confusion . \"",

            "message": "kansas city is robert altman's disappointing followup to the equally disappointing ready to wear , which underwhelmed critics and audiences alike following its christmas 1994 release . while kansas city is a modest step forward for one of america's most-respected independent directors , it falls far short of the raw power of short cuts or the intricate , biting satire of the player . kansas city is a sadly ordinary motion picture , and , in less sure hands , it might have been something of an unfortunate mess . even with altman at the helm , however , it manages to be singularly unremarkable . this hasn't been a very good summer for \" respected \" directors . altman's kansas city comes in the wake of bernardo bertolucci's vapid stealing beauty and jim jarmusch's bizarre dead man , neither of which received more than a handful of positive reviews . taking place over a forty-eight hour period around election day , 1934 , in altman's hometown of kansas city , the movie is carefully attentive of period details . sets , costumes , and props are all evocative of the time , when kansas city was booming in the midst of the country's great depression . the jazz soundtrack sizzles , with performances by the likes of joshua redman , craig handy , cyrus chestnut , kevin mahogany , james carter , and geri allen . yet , although the movie gets the minutiae right , it stumbles over characterization and plot . like an improperly-focused photograph , the background is crisp and clear , but the foreground is muddled . here , while leigh's performance leaves a definite impression , it's also out-of-synch with everyone else's . her character , who is largely a two-dimensional caricature , never interacts effectively with anyone , least of all miranda richardson's carolyn stilton , in whose company she spends the entire movie . as usual in an altman film , this narrative element eventually dovetails with the primary one . in the past , altman has successfully used multi-story narratives with ensemble casts to great effect ( nashville , short cuts ) , but not this time around . done straight , with altman's usual flair for intricate character development , there's a lot of potential in kansas city's basic plot . inexplicably , however , altman decided to do the movie with a satirical edge . the film plays like part homage , part affectionate parody of old- time noir thrillers . the three main characters -- blondie , carolyn , and seldom -- are intentionally developed as types rather than as fully- fleshed out personalities . there are numerous occasions when altman obviously has his tongue planted in his cheek . unfortunately , that storytelling method doesn't really work in this setting . kansas city has an uneven , confused tone . there's nothing uncertain about the jazz sequences , however . altman has filmed them from a fan's perspective , and the scenes that take place in seldom's hey-hey club during an all-night cutting contest are infused with an energy that's lacking elsewhere . music aficionados , especially those who appreciate the tunes of kansas city's era , will find a great deal to appreciate about the film . others , especially those expecting something profound from an altman feature , will discover that , though kansas city has its share of arresting moments , the production as a whole is too superficial to be considered amongst the director's best work .",

            "message": "date released : 12/17/93 ( limited release ) running length : 2 : 02 rated : pg-13 ( nudity , language , mature themes ) starring : robert duvall , richard harris , shirley maclaine , sandra bullock , piper laurie director : randa haines producers : joe wizan and todd black screenplay : steve conrad music : michael convertino released by warner brothers there's a lot of academy award potential in wrestling ernest hemingway . not only is the cast a virtual who's-who of past nominees and winners in the acting categories , but director randa haines was responsible for the highly-regarded william hurt/marlee matlin drama children of a lesser god . walt , on the other hand , is neat and orderly . wrestling ernest hemingway shows what an excellent cast can do with an average script . steve conrad's debut screenplay says little that hasn't been presented before , but the actors make it seem fresher and more powerful than it has a right to be . stripped down to its essentials , this is a buddy film that also tackles the issue of coping with old age and its accompanying loss of virility . there's no attempt to break new ground , and no sense that the script is willing to take chances . you can predict the ending long before it comes to pass . robert duvall always assures a director of a solid performance , and walt is one of his best-acted roles in years . even though duvall is easily twenty years younger than his character , there's never a credibility problem . he plays walt with a simple sensitivity that's at times poignant or humorous . duvall's abilities are so chameleon-like that it's difficult to believe that this is the same man from another current release , geronimo . \" oscar-worthy \" is an overused term , but it applies in this case . not many of his films have been box office successes , but harris' performances have never been the problem . harris' frank isn't developed with the subtlety of duvall's walt , but frank is a much more boisterous and raucous personality . the three women have supporting roles . sandra bullock is likable as elaine , the only under-fifty member of the cast . shirley maclaine doesn't have much to do as helen coonie , but she asserts her presence effectively in two pivotal scenes . piper laurie's georgia is pretty much a wasted character , and ms . laurie's performance is the only one that's below the expected level . as is the case with many movies that deal with friendship and aging issues , wrestling ernest hemingway doesn't go anywhere . that's not really a problem , but the total length of the movie could have been cut by about fifteen minutes without losing anything . this film doesn't need to be two hours long . humor and pathos are nicely mixed , but this is expected from any moderately-successful entry into the genre . in may ways , this is the male version of the cemetery club , with many of the same themes confronted from the other gender's point-of-view . wrestling ernest hemingway is more entertaining--the cemetery club never quite clicked--but those who have seen both films will recognize the similarities . warner brothers is having a hard time promoting wrestling ernest hemingway , and the likely result will be a poor showing at the box office . they have an understandable problem , since the movie doesn't offer a whole lot of quick clips to attract viewers . it's a shame , really , because while this movie has its fair share of flaws , there is an audience for it . the problem is that they probably won't know that it exists .",

            "message": "despite a reasonably original story line , familiar characters , first rate special effects , and the hallmark meeting between captains kirk ( william shatner ) and picard ( patrick stewart ) , there's something fundamentally dissatisfying about this , the seventh \" star trek \" feature film . the problem is that while star trek : generations is undeniably a major motion picture , too often it seems like little more than an over-budgeted , double-length episode of the \" next generation \" television series . if the spirit of the series is ever again to boldly go , it will have to rise , phoenix-like , from the ashes . it's difficult to say how the general public will react to this film . unlike the previous sequels , generations is largely inaccessible to non- \" trek \" aficionados . however , with its focus on character development over action , it should prove enjoyable for those well-acquainted with the voyages of any enterprise . one of generations' strengths is its willingness to take chances with the familiar \" star trek \" mythos . this movie spends as much time tearing down old bridges as building new ones . there are problems , however , several of which are too obvious to ignore . first time feature director david carson's inexperience is at times evident . his film is inconsistently paced , with a few space battle/action scenes sprinkled liberally throughout an otherwise talky , protracted story . a combat sequence between the uss enterprise \" d \" and a klingon ship lacks any semblance of tension . looking back at the ship-to-ship duels of movies 2 , 3 , and 6 , there was a flair and buildup that is noticeably absent here . the battles in generations are hurried , and the viewer appears to be watching rather than participating , with little opportunity to savor the moment . equally unimpressive is carson's handling of a certain highly-emotional moment that figures prominently in the climax . again , perhaps he's rushing things , but those of us in the audience recognize that the scene should be far more affecting than it actually is . by comparison , generations' last moments are flat . malcolm mcdowell plays the latest--and probably the weakest-- \" star trek \" film villain . this is precisely because mcdowell's soran is too restrained-- \" trek \" bad guys tend to be at their best when hamming it up . shatner wears kirk like a comfortable garment , and somehow the film seems more alive when he's on screen . stewart , the consummate professional , is undeniably the better actor , but his presence isn't as arresting . even brent spiner , despite a wonderful , often-comic performance as lt . commander data , can't fill the gap left when kirk isn't around . one thing made obvious by this picture is that the \" star trek \" movies are in desperate need of musical continuity . dennis mccarthy is the fifth composer in seven films , and his score is perhaps the most bland of all . except during certain key moments when the alexander courage signature tune is used , most of generations' unmemorable music fades into the dimly-lit background . lovers of frantically-paced science fiction may find generations too static , and fans of the original series will likely be disappointed by the limited screen time accorded kirk , scotty , and chekov ( not to mention the absence of spock , bones , sulu , and uhura ) mostly , generations spends its running length searching for--and never completely finding--its niche . if there is an eighth \" star trek \" film , and generations isn't the series' epitaph , perhaps eliminating the burden of mixing characters from different eras will permit a less-erratic plot line . either way , however , \" star trek \" will never be the same . age and a few too many bad stories may have robbed kirk and company of their vitality , but nothing can take away their mystique--and that is the quality which will sorely be missed .",

            "message": "combine the talents of director robert altman and actors kenneth branagh and robert duvall , and you have the apparent recipe for a motion picture worth waiting for . but , although the gingerbread man is a finely-tuned example of mainstream entertainment , and holds the audience's interest for most of its running length , it is a little disappointing . perhaps the problem is that the story was written by john grisham , and , as one might expect , it doesn't stray far from the standard grisham formula . or maybe it's that altman has gotten lazy recently . following the less-than-stellar ready to wear and kansas city , the gingerbread man ( a blatantly commercial effort ) isn't likely to appease those questing for the next altman masterpiece . one of altman's strengths , most evident in films like nashville and short cuts , is character development , so it's no surprise that we are introduced to a gallery of interesting individuals . altman ratchets up the tension during this section of the film , providing a few genuine edge-of-the- seat moments . it's in the final half hour that the gingerbread man starts to lose its way . the denouement and ending , while in keeping with what we expect from a grisham-penned tale , are pedestrian , offering only contrived surprises . nevertheless , in part because i had invested so much into the characters over the film's better first two-thirds , i was able to accept , if not applaud , the resolution . the plot has its share of logical flaws , but that's standard for all but the very best thrillers . the gingerbread man's undeniable primary strength is the level of acting . branagh , whose training in shakespeare gives him a tendency to overact ( see mary shelly's frankenstein if you don't believe me ) , gives a perfectly-modulated performance under altman's direction . branagh's nick is strong , decisive , and obviously human . embeth davidtz , who has essayed a number of roles since her eye-opening turn in schindler's list , does her best work here since the holocaust drama , easily surpassing her bland turn in the recent fallen . ( this may be the only time hannah's acting hasn't stuck out like a sore thumb . ) the only flat portrayal belongs to famke janssen ( as nick's ex-wife ) , but at least she's better here than she was in deep rising . at its best , the gingerbread man evokes memories of alfred hitchcock , the master of suspense who used every tool at his disposal to trick , cajole , and manipulate the audience into a state of heightened anxiety . one of the mechanisms employed here by altman is the weather - - it always seems to be raining , and the approach of the hurricane promises even more wind and water . fortunately , the storm sequences are impressively filmed and serve to enhance the atmosphere , rather than drown it ( like in hard rain ) . although the gingerbread man has its faults , there are enough fine moments and solid performances to more than balance them out . while altman aficionados may be disappointed by the conventional nature of the production , fans of writer john grisham ( who gets story , but not screenplay , credit ) will probably feel right at home . the legal thriller has become grisham's home field , and the gingerbread man , with an accomplished director at the helm , is as worthwhile as anything he has helped bring to the screen . the result is an entertaining and sporadically engrossing two hours . - ingmar bergman",

            "message": "the songs are '50s style hits that have shown their enduring popularity . many fans of movie musicals recall grease with fondness . it certainly isn't a momentous film , and stands a considerable distance downslope from the pinnacle its genre , but it became a huge hit in an era when the musical was well into its death throes . aside from the likes of little shop of horrors ( 1986 ) , the disney animated films , and evita ( 1996 ) , there have been few memorable , big-budget motion picture musicals since grease . the film was also popular enough to spawn a sequel , catchily titled grease 2 , but the less said about that sad endeavor , the better . no one thinks grease's 1998 box office total will come close to that of the first installment of george lucas' space opera , but it should still make a tidy profit . the digitally-remastered soundtrack ( which sounds great ) and the enhanced color can only help . grease boasts what all successful motion picture musicals have : likable stars , a simple but not trivial plot , and a lot of enjoyable music . familiarity with the soundtrack is undoubtedly one of the reasons for the film's popularity ? several of the songs have achieved pop hit status . who can't recognize \" grease , \" \" hopelessly devoted to you , \" \" you're the one that i want , \" \" greased lightning , \" and \" summer nights \" ? these may not represent great music , but they're a lot of fun to listen to , as their abiding appeal proves . their eventual reunion , however , is anything but joyous . to sandy , the reaction is like a slap in the face . in addition to the songs , highlights of grease include travolta's daffy , limber performance as danny , newton-john's sexy-but-sweet sandy , and a cast of adults trying vainly to pass themselves off as high- schoolers . despite all of the silliness and singing , the exuberance of youth lies at the core of grease , and , although everything is greatly exaggerated here , the film brings back memories of what it was like to hang out in the school yard , take a date to a drive-in movie , and attend a prom . alternately swaggering to prove his \" coolness \" and re-affirming his ability on the dance floor , the actor gives the kind of performance that's perfect for the role . meanwhile , newton-john is equally solid , even though , at the time , she was far better known for making records than movies . sandy's transformation from shy wallflower to leather-clad babe is one of the film's best-remembered moments . the supporting cast contains a number of familiar faces . grease works as a musical , a comedy , a light romance , and a gentle satire of teenage life during the '50s . in part because of its persistent high spirits , it's a delight to watch , even 20 years after it first appeared on the screen . there's no doubt that grease has a devoted legion of fans , so it will be interesting to see how well the movie performs at the box office . after all , it is readily available on video tape , and , unlike last year's big re-release , there are no restored outtakes and enhanced special effects . the only things grease has to rely upon are its reputation and its music . for me , at least , that's enough for a trip to the theater . \" my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . \" -- david puttnam",

            "message": "what would it be like if celebrated playwright and screenwriter david mamet collaborated with franz kafka ? while we'll never know for sure , the spanish prisoner gives a good indication . this film , the fifth to be authored and directed by mamet ( whose recent script contributions include the edge and wag the dog ) , is both a sendup of the hitchcock-type thriller and a legitimate entry into the genre . it's mamet's most convoluted plot since house of games , but , while the overall structure and style are of noir twistiness , the underlying message is something almost any viewer can relate to : how corporate greed destroys trust and corrupts honest men . mamet's script supplies us with a seemingly-endless series of twists and turns , only a fraction of which are predictable . at times , the audience is a step ahead of the screenplay , but , most of the time , we're playing catch-up . although there are plenty of holes that mamet has no interest is sewing up ( trying to solve every riddle in the spanish prisoner is an exercise in futility ) , this is a smart film that develops a central character we can sympathize with ? a modern version of josef k . from kafka's the trial . the plot is delightfully preposterous , but holds together a lot better than the generic likes of palmetto and wild things . the difference is simple : those two films are for viewers who prefer to turn their brains off while the spanish prisoner is for anyone who likes to think and feel along with the characters . the most curious thing about the spanish prisoner is the ending ( which i will not reveal in this review ) . at first glance , it appears to be a common wrap-up that ties together several critical loose ends . there's a deus ex machina aspect to it which may indicate that mamet is toying with the audience by sending up the manner in which this kind of movie must end to satisfy an audience . but are things as straightforward as they seem ? is this , in fact , the end , or is it just the latest twist in an incredibly complex con game ? the dialogue is , of course , pure mamet . the writer/director's characteristic style infuses every exchange with its peculiar , staccato rhythm . there are those who find mamet's approach to be off-putting , but , for movie-goers who allow its strange allure to captivate them ( which usually takes a few minutes ) , it becomes apparent how crucial it is to the film's overall tone . mamet has achieved something extraordinary ? a pg rating . one of the reasons the film is so strong is that nearly every major performance is impeccable . steve martin plays jimmy dell with the right mix of charm and menace . the subtext of this film is the same as the one in many other mamet offerings ? how the current business climate rewards those who act ruthlessly and punishes those who hold to a code of ethics . with a plot that would make hitchcock proud , the spanish prisoner uses this outrageously elaborate , always-entertaining approach to illustrate these more serious concerns about what it takes to survive the '90s . \" my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . \" -- david puttnam",

            "message": "when one thinks of scandinavian movies , the name of ingmar bergman leaps to mind . the great swedish director's films were almost always austere , beautifully-made , and intellectual ( sometimes to a fault ) . as a result , those whose expectations for junk mail are based on bergman , are in for something of a shock . this movie , the product of norwegian first-time director pal sletaune , owes more to david lynch and denmark's the kingdom than it does to the work of bergman , troell , or any other notable scandinavian film maker . most of the film takes place in the seed , dirty , and dreary backrooms and alleys of oslo , and the characters are like rejects from terry gilliam's brazil . and , although junk mail threads its way through a series of potentially-serious issues , sletaune keeps the tone comical ( albeit darkly so ) . in many ways , this is a strange movie ; i liked it in spite of the characters , who could charitably be called unpleasant losers , and in spite of the grungy atmosphere , which seems to have soaked into the bones of everyone populating the picture . junk mail generated an incredibly strong buzz at last year's toronto film festival ( where i had originally planned to see it ) . instead of faithfully delivering parcels and envelopes to their rightful destinations ( see kevin costner's the postman if you want this kind of mentality ) , he dumps about half of his load so he can spend hours loafing . not surprisingly , the standout performance in junk mail belongs to robert skjaerstad , who manages to make a worm like roy seem believable . >from time-to-time , we actually find ourselves feeling something close to sympathy for him . andrine saether is pleasant as line . per egil aske plays georg as a cross between a conscienceless sociopath and a bumbling idiot . he's deadly , but a little too stupid to be truly frightening . this edgy , entirely original movie succeeds for a couple of reasons : it isn't afraid of breaking the rules ( the lead character is a pathetic loser who never finds redemption ) and it never overexplains itself to the audience . it's a fresh , quirky picture that will appeal to anyone looking for something that , as monty python put it , is completely different . the only real downside is that the conclusion is a little too open-ended to be fully satisfying . up to that point , however , junk mail is an entertainingly offbeat experience . it's unclear whether this will get any kind of widespread u . s . distribution , but it has already become , and will likely continue to be , a film festival favorite . \" my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . \" -- david puttnam",

            "message": "oscar wilde -- satirist , playwright , and novelist -- was one of the great figures of the late 19th century . like many artistic figures throughout history , wilde's reputation has waxed and waned with the mutation of the social climate . today , he is regarded as a literary giant , and perhaps the best playwright of the second half of the 19th century . despite an uneven script and a rather mundane , occasionally-plodding narrative , the movie is compelling , largely because wilde's life was fascinating . throw in a number of top- notch performances and , even without any flourishes , the film offers a solid two hours of entertainment , and , for anyone unfamiliar with wilde or his work , perhaps education . as is often the case with a movie that crams 15 years of history into 120 minutes ( for the non-mathematical , that's only 8 minutes per year ) , there's a lack of consistency in the tone . certain characters and subplots are sadly neglected . in particular , i was disappointed with the handling of wilde's home life and marriage , which , for a man of his nature , was surely a point of great personal conflict and uncertainty . the few brief scenes of wilde with his wife and children didn't satisfy my curiosity , and the resolution of this story aspect felt sadly incomplete . there are times throughout the entire film when subplots drag on a little too long -- the relationship between wilde and bosie is a prime example . ironically , despite the languid pace of much of the film , the last 20 to 30 minutes have a rushed feel , almost as if the director realized he was running out of time and wanted to compress as much into the proceedings as he could . through it all , however , wilde stands tall as the magnetic central figure . for fry , this is a dream role -- in a recent conversation over dinner , he spoke eloquently and at length about his passion for wilde and his work . considering the sprawling nature of the narrative , fry is given a daunting task -- keep the audience involved in the story and anchored to the character -- that he carries off without seeming difficulty . volatile , passionate , occasionally spiteful , and often impatient , bosie has the kind of multifaceted personality that captures and holds our attention . law's careful performance makes it impossible to love or hate the man -- at times , he's a monster ; at other times , he's an angel . despite limited screen time , ehle manages to fashion connie wilde into a heartbreakingly sympathetic character , which makes the truncation of that subplot all the more frustrating . one of the many things wilde does right is to convey a sense of the man apart from his work . during the course of the film , wilde is often compared to some sort of literary prophet ( he has \" disciples \" ) , and it's easy to see how young men would be attracted to this charming , erudite man who uses his \" wit as a foil . \" ultimately , while wilde lacks the depth and substance of the best biographical features , it's nevertheless a strong enough contender to deserve a trip to the local theater , especially with pickings so slim this summer . \" my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . \" -- david puttnam",

            "message": "there are two kinds of viewers for the x-files movie : those have seen at least a few episodes of the tv series and those who have never watched it . i am a member of the latter group , so that's the perspective from which this review is written . as a result , i cannot assess how the film will appeal to a die-hard follower of the program . but , for the \" uneducated \" movie-goer , the x-files offers two hours of solid entertainment . ( of course , one unanswered question is how many non-x files aficionados will exhibit sufficient interest to venture into a theater showing this picture . ) transferring a television program to the big screen has become a routine procedure for a film industry starved for ideas , but this is a rare occasion when the movies continue the adventures begun on the small screen , with no re-casting involved . twentieth century fox is hoping the wrinkle : the television series is still going strong . in interviews , writer/producer/series creator chris carter has stated that his goal with the x-files was to make a movie that could stand on its own . there's no question that he has succeeded . the script can be followed by someone with literally no previous knowledge of the characters or situations . ( by \" cleverly , \" i mean that these passages don't cry out , \" character exposition ! \" ) although i'm told that the storyline picks up where the last season of the tv program left off , there's no sense that new viewers are entering in the middle of things . the only obvious concession to the ongoing series is the ending , which includes several hooks that can be used to launch stories in the upcoming season . mulder and scully have exchanged their investigations of things paranormal and extraterrestrial for more mundane matters such as terrorism . plot-wise , the x-files bears more than a passing resemblance to 1996's alien invasion/conspiracy movie , the arrival . although things get sloppy near the end , when several story holes are ignored or ineffectively plugged , the script as a whole exhibits an uncommon intelligence for this type of movie . in addition , director rob bowman ( who has helmed a number of the tv episodes ) maintains a fairly high level of tension as the complexities of the multi-layered plot mount . the movie is perhaps a little too long ; cutting ten or fifteen minutes would have made for a better focused adventure . it's not hard to understand the appeal of mulder and scully . it also doesn't hurt that they're both likable and neither is hard on the eyes . actors david duchovny ( who's no stranger to movies ; his most recent foray being playing god ) and gillian anderson ( who is more familiar to viewers of the small screen than the large one ) are both accomplished and entirely believable in these roles . of course , we would expect no less of them , since they have been inhabiting these fictitious shells for five years . the chemistry between them is palpable , blending camaraderie and respect with a little subtle romance . having seen the movie , it's easy for me to comprehend why so many people are enamored with the series . although a lot of the material explored in the x-files isn't new or revolutionary , the style of presentation and the quality of the writing set this above most other conspiracy theory/alien invasion pictures . i won't claim that the experience of having watched this film will suddenly convert me into a weekly viewer of the tv show , but at least now i'm aware of what awaits if i choose to catch an episode . in a summer that has been characterized by over-hyped and largely pointless big-budget films , the offerings . \" my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . \" -- david puttnam",

            "message": "out of respect for the stunning visuals and family entertainment value of disney's 34th animated feature , i can do no less than recommend the hunchback of notre dame . sadly , however , this is the least- enjoyable animated feature to come from the studio since its 1989 rebirth . the hunchback of notre dame is a notch below last year's pocahontas , which , in turn , was a drop from the previous year's the lion king . still , all things considered , the hunchback of notre dame isn't bad , it's just a little disappointing . despite the over-hyped and overexaggerated \" darkness \" of the production , kids will love it , so a box office success is assured . and those who carefully review the family entertainment competition this summer will rightfully conclude that hunchback is the surest bet . it's curious that the movie to use the most adult source material has yielded the least potent results . obviously , victor hugo's vision of the hunchback of notre dame couldn't be made into a disney cartoon -- it violates almost every aspect of the studio's traditional , feel- good/happy ending formula . so , predictably , the screenwriters diluted it , but , in doing so , they siphoned off the elements that give the story its unique power . with the darkest and most unpleasant aspects of hugo's tragedy eradicated , there's not much left . the poorly-focused remains are likely to appeal most strongly to the under-12 crowd . unlike past efforts , there aren't many in-jokes and double-entendres to catch the attention of the adults in the audience . the film loosely follows hugo's narrative . in hugo's book , the interaction between these characters fuels a complex and multi- layered drama . for , although we come to feel for \" quasi \" , neither esmeralda nor phoebus makes a dent in our sympathy . he's not monstrous or ugly ; he's just different . children who consider themselves oddballs or outcasts will likely identify with the hunchback . and the life-lesson about tolerance and respect for others will be understood by nearly everyone who watches the film . according to disney , frollo is the most conflicted and complex villain to have ever been brought to the animated screen . i suppose that's true on one level -- after all , he's tormented by his own lustful impulses , and acts out of religious zeal rather than plain nastiness -- but i doubt many viewers will notice . ultimately , frollo comes across as a bigoted , intolerant , but not overly-frightening , bad guy . the most impressive thing about him is tony jay's deep , resonant voice . from a musical standpoint , the hunchback of notre dame is lifeless . the songs , co-written by composer alan menken and lyricist stephen schwartz , lack energy . there are no show-stopping , toe-tapping numbers . in fact , there's nothing remotely memorable about any aspect of hunchback's soundtrack -- it's easily the poorest effort to come from menken since he started churning out scores for disney ( he's done all of the new wave animated features except the lion king ) . on the other hand , the animation is crisper and more impressive than anything since beauty and the beast , and certain computer-aided sequences are even more eye-popping than beauty's sterling ballroom scene . the festival of fools , where quasimodo first ventures out of the bell tower , is a riot of color and movement , with intricately-animated backgrounds that are more interesting than the foregrounds . if you believe that the primary purpose for animated films is to enthrall children , the hunchback of notre dame is an unquestionable success . if you're looking for entertainment for the whole family , this movie will fit the bill . but if you're anticipating something that's as diverting for adults as for younger viewers , hunchback may disappoint . since the release of the little mermaid , disney has set a high standard for its animated work , and , for the first time , one of the studio's releases struggles to distinguish itself .",

            "message": "and , as strange as it may sound , the central tragedy of this film is likely to affect viewers far more than it appears to affect the main character . they believed that only in this way could they properly capture the essence of the man whose experiences they were dramatizing . however , feynman himself once said , \" the way to hell is paved with good intentions \" , and this may be a good example . for , as effective as much of the film is , feynman's apparent detachment at the end leaves us cold -- almost as if things matter more to us than they do to him . as background , the los alamos material is effective , but , on those occasions when it is thrust into the foreground , it pales in comparison to the love story . the bulk of the film has nothing to do with los alamos , the bomb , or j . robert oppenheimer . rather , it's about richard and his intense , unwavering love for arline . fate , however , has a cruel sense of humor . as told here , arline and richard's touching love story is devoid of sensationalism . only in the end , when richard fails to display any significant emotion following arline's death , does infinity strike a wrong chord . feynman may have really given this rather clinical , dispassionate assessment : \" everybody dies . but it's tough to get an audience to accept that a loving husband could turn into such a cold fish . shadowlands , this isn't . despite this possible miscalculation regarding the character , matthew broderick gives a fine portrayal of feynman . the physicist's natural curiosity about science and the natural world are very much in evidence . and broderick's enthusiasm is contagious . if , as feynman suggests , mathematics are a foreign language , we're more than willing to let him translate for us . even though there are a few anecdotes involving protons , electrons , neutrons , splitting atoms , inertia , and infinity , a detailed knowledge of physics and mathematics isn't necessary to enjoy the film . infinity represents a journey of emotional and scientific discovery . it's just unfortunate that the ending isn't more fundamentally satisfying . that single flaw keeps this from being a remarkable feature . -- ingmar bergman",

            "message": "inertia . the dictionary defines it as \" a property of matter by which it remains at rest or in uniform motion , \" and this is an apt descriptor for paul thomas anderson's debut feature , hard eight . during the first half , virtually nothing happens -- the characters are stuck in a stasis from which escape seems impossible . then , during the second half , momentum carries the story to its inescapable conclusion . the dualistic nature of hard eight makes it a difficult picture to size up . at times , it's engrossing , but , on other occasions , it's a lesson in frustration . hard eight opens with a fascinating , twenty-minute prologue . sydney's scam is deceptively simple and undeniably effective , and anderson presents it with flair and an undercurrent of wry humor . hard eight borrows its share of conventions from noir thrillers , but this is more of a character drama than anything else . i said earlier that portions of hard eight are frustrating . indeed , some scenes are almost painful to watch because of everyone's inability to act decisively . people talk and talk and talk , but the words don't mean anything , and nothing gets resolved . characters frequently speak in an elliptical manner , taking forever to get to the point . it's the inertia thing . there's a palpable reluctance to change to status quo . anyone expecting the high-octane , pop-saturated drive of pulp fiction will be disappointed . hard eight is a different sort of movie altogether . in fact , it owes more to films like the music of chance than to tarantino's effort . the dialogue is rich but never glib , and the characters , all pictures of loneliness in one way or another , are carefully drawn and developed . in fact , about the only elements pulp fiction and hard eight have in common are stylistic similarities grounded in the noir tradition and effective performances by the always- solid samuel l . jackson . jackson is great , as is gwyneth paltrow , but those two only have supporting roles . the core of hard eight , and the reason to see it , is the dynamic between philip baker hall's sydney and john c . reilly's john . though sydney exudes a confident , assured manner , it doesn't take long for us to recognize the desperation and loneliness eating away at him from within . hall brings this out subtlety , through a carefully- modulated performance that will linger in the mind long after the details of hard eight's minimalist plot have faded . hard eight perhaps teases us with more than it delivers . the casino scenes have a sense of energy and verisimilitude that isn't always present when the action switches to swank hotel room and sleazy dives . yet there's something almost hypnotic about the way hard eight develops -- even in its slowest , most tedious moments , it keeps our attention . and , at a time when independent films are relying ever more on comfortable formulas , that's something of an accomplishment .",

            "message": "it's actually a difficult decision , because , although the two movies have vastly different strengths and weaknesses , the bottom line is that they're of similar quality . grosse pointe blank is , at times , too dark and disjointed . romy and michele's high school reunion is , on the other hand , occasionally a little too light and vacuous . and , if grosse pointe has too much of an edge , then romy and michele doesn't have enough of one . that said , those expecting a female version of dumb and dumber are in for a disappointment . yes , romy ( mira sorvino ) and michele ( lisa kudrow ) have vacuum-filled brain cavities , and the film doesn't shy away from raunchy sexual innuendo , but the pervasive flatulence of the jim carrey/jeff daniels comedy is entirely absent . they have been friends for a lot longer -- two inseparable peas in a pod who have never fit in with the hip crowd and have never cared that they're outsiders . under the control of two such deft comic talents , romy and michele are exaggerated just enough to be funny but not so much that they're unsympathetic . in fact , the most disturbing thing about romy and michele is recognizing that there are actually people in this world who think and act like these two cartoon characters do . although i smiled frequently during the film , i didn't laugh too often . perhaps surprisingly , a lot of the humor is low-key , and there are very few truly hilarious moments . another problem is that the script unsuccessfully attempts to inject a little lame drama with a moral ( \" be true to yourself \" ) into the mix . i have no problem with ambitious comedies introducing dramatic elements into the storyline , but those aspects should be less banal than the ones pulled off the \" stock plot device \" shelf for this movie . romy and michele is at its best when it's being lighthearted and at its weakest when it takes a halfhearted stab at semi-seriousness . as in grosse pointe blank , the reunion is something of a disappointment ( actually , for reasons i won't go into here , there are two reunions ) . the final forty-five minutes features a few clever moments ( including a bizarre dance number with sorvino , kudrow , and alan cumming ) , but almost all of the best scenes occur during the first half . romy and michele boasts a lively supporting cast . julia campbell ( tv's men behaving badly ) is that staple of the reunion movie -- the stuck-up prom queen whose vocabulary is made up solely of put-downs . romy and michele's high school reunion is one of those pleasant movie-going experiences that doesn't offend , excite , or challenge anyone . there are all sorts of likable things about it -- sorvino and kudrow , accessible humor , and an '80s soundtrack that's the most definitive survey of the decade in pop music since peter's friends . first-time director david mirkin brings a lot of energy to the production , always keeping things moving . and , perhaps most intriguingly , anyone who has ever gone to a reunion will recognize a kernel of truth lurking under all of romy and michele's blond and brainless icing .",

            "message": "every time audiences are presented with a reasonably well-made serial killer movie , they line up for it . why ? human beings are irresistibly fascinated by the lurid , the horrifying , and the depraved , and what could be more attention-grabbing than an individual who murders repeatedly in sick and twisted ways ? of course , serial killers ( both real and fictional ) have provided material for countless movies , but most of those are artless hack jobs , replacing tension and intelligence with gore and cliches . so , when a movie comes along that's a cut above the usual , it's worth making note of . kiss the girls is such a film . i'm not saying that kiss the girls is a great motion picture , nor am i arguing that it's the best of its kind to come out in recent years . but it features a pair of well-developed characters , the plot contains some clever twists and turns , the dialogue is reasonable , and director gary fleder ( things to do in denver when you're dead ) keeps the level of tension and intrigue high . put together , all of that adds up to a worthwhile motion picture . fans of seven , copycat , and silence of the lambs will likely agree that their $8 admission for kiss the girls is well spent . kiss the girls wouldn't be nearly as involving without the two strong performances of the leads . freeman plays alex as an insightful , confident investigator with powerful emotions bubbling just beneath his calm , carefully-controlled exterior . as kate , judd adds another impressive performance to a growing resume . the actress plays her character as outwardly-tough and self-sufficient with an inner core of vulnerability . nevertheless , vulnerability , whether emotional or physical , is something she has a hard time coping with . one thing i appreciate about kiss the girls is its willingness to spend time developing the characters before jumping into the main story . there are times when it manifests itself almost as a father/daughter bond , but , on other occasions , there's a sense of latent romance . however , the film underplays this dynamic to avoid wandering off on a tangent . despite being consistently involving , kiss the girls , based on the best-selling novel by james patterson , has its share of flaws . on several occasions , the film's blatant ignorance of real-world police procedures strains the viewer's credibility . i also have a gripe about the end scenes , which are overly familiar . with one exception , the acting is solid . although elwes only portrays a small-town cop , and doesn't steal any scenes , he's never particularly believable , and every time he's on screen , he sticks out like a sore thumb . the film makers , with a nod to the success of seven , have apparently decided to mimic the grim atmosphere and in-your-face cinematography of that movie ( light , darkness , and shadow are used to great effect here ) . stylistically , kiss the girls is very similar , and the presence of morgan freeman only heightens the connection . even though there are vast plot differences between the two , both are well- made and are likely to appeal to the same kind of audience . so , much like seven , kiss the girls makes for a suspenseful , if somewhat bleak , two hours . \" the cinema is not an art which films life : the cinema is something between art and life . unlike painting and literature , the cinema both gives to life and takes from it . . . \" - jean-luc godard",

            "message": "it's frequently a melodramatic and cloying process , and , even when there are gifted actors involved ( such as holly hunter in the jodie foster-directed home for the holidays ) , watching such a film can be a dull , uninvolving process . with the myth of fingerprints , however , writer/director bart freundlich has scored a coup : he has created a low-key holiday drama that's refreshing not only because it lacks the big discovery melodrama of most similar movies but because it's entirely believable . the same cannot be said of most of the returning children . at its best , the myth of fingerprints is a sensitive , intelligent examination of the dynamics of a dysfunctional family ( note : families in movies like this must always be dysfunctional , otherwise there wouldn't be much of a story ) . at its worst , which isn't often , freundlich's feature debut runs into difficulties with cliches : the overbearing father who has left his \" fingerprints \" on the lives of each of his offspring , the search by various couples to rekindle the old flame , etc . one of the most atypical aspects of the myth of fingerprints is that it isn't loaded with \" shocking \" revelations ? everything is pretty much as it seems and the friction between the characters is the result of normal causes rather than motion picture contrivances . plus , in true slice-of-life fashion , hardly anything gets wrapped up over the course of the picture . we see a few small dramas play themselves out , but the larger story , which began long before the picture's opening credits , is not cleanly closed . freundlich has a good sense of what makes for absorbing drama ? a quality that consistently applies to the myth of fingerprints . through strong , well-focused writing and with the help of a uniformly effective cast , the director gets us to care about every member of the family in a remarkably short span of time . the dialogue is also thoughtful and insightful , rather than trite . examples include warren's explanation for why he's going home this year for thanksgiving : \" it's been long enough that i can't quite remember that i shouldn't go , \" and mia's observation that family members are \" the first people you're supposed to be hostile to . \" the myth of fingerprints contains a number of noteworthy scenes , including some strangely quiet dinners and awkward moments between estranged siblings . but the best sequence occurs early in the film , on the night when everyone has finally assembled under one roof . one-by- one , the various couples begin to make love , and the concert of moans , thumps , and squeaks creates an atmosphere that is both poignant and funny , especially as we observe warren's reaction to all the noise around him . nothing much happens during the myth of fingerprints , but that's the point . for 90 minutes , freundlich opens a window into the lives of a few characters , and our perspective is so clear that we feel we get to know them . so , although the material is not especially challenging , the results are among the best for an american film of this genre . for those who appreciate this sort of simple drama , the myth of fingerprints is worth a trip to the theater . \" for me , the cinema is not a slice of life , but a piece of cake . \"",

            "message": "planes , trains , and automobiles , a 1987 feature from john hughes , represented something of a watershed in the career of the prolific writer/director/producer . unlike most film makers working in that arena , hughes eschewed the cheap t&a exploitation of flicks like porky's in favor of surprisingly sensitive character interaction and relationship building . my recollection of seeing planes , trains , and automobiles during its theatrical run was that i laughed hard and often . re-watching it recently , however , i was struck that , while the comedy is undeniable , the dramatic underpinning of the script is stronger than i remembered . the \" hook \" that draws the viewer in is the humor , but the movie's real appeal is the characters . don't mistake what i'm saying -- there's nothing deep , dark , or profound lurking in the subtext . this isn't dostoevsky , nor does it want to be . but it takes the time to round out the protagonists and allow us to care about what happens to them . there are moments in this film that tug at the heartstrings . this is like martin scorsese's after hours on a grander , less psychotic scale . but bad weather intervenes . what makes the trip even longer is that neal is stuck next to one of those good-natured , annoying talkers who won't shut up . we know they're eventually going to reach the windy city , so the fun is watching their slow , reluctant bonding as they take planes , trains , automobiles , and tractor trailers to get there . but , although he has a few memorable \" wild and crazy guy \" outbursts , martin's performance is largely restrained . he does a good job presenting the increasingly-desperate facade of a normal guy who is enduring a living nightmare , and who really doesn't want to have anything to do with the jovial boob who is drawn to him like a fly to garbage . martin enables us to empathize with neal by conveying the important fact that he isn't a nasty person -- he's just someone who's reacting badly to his circumstances . candy imbues del with more depth that one initially expects from the big man . one of the keys to planes , trains , and automobiles' success is that both actors develop their characters into fully-formed individuals instead of caricatures . planes , trains , and automobiles is one of those rare movies that manages to mingle outrageous comedy and light drama in such a way that we aren't repulsed or offended by its simplicity and occasional mawkishness . it's a fine cinematic treat that doesn't demand much from a viewer , but gives back a lot , both in terms of laughter and good feeling . \" for me , the cinema is not a slice of life , but a piece of cake . \"",

            "message": "in an era when movies are again turning to classic literature for inspiration , it was only a matter of time before a new version of charlotte bronte's jane eyre reached the screen . one of the best-loved of all the victorian novels , jane eyre combines social commentary with gothic romance . this new film , directed by franco zeffirelli ( best known for his 1968 oscar-nominated romeo and juliet ) , remains faithful to the original narrative in general , if not in all the particulars . of necessity , the story has been condensed , since it isn't possible to reproduce a full-length book as a two-hour movie . screenwriters zeffirelli and hugh whitemore have elected to retain jane eyre's full scope while elimiting many of the nuances . the result is a reasonably fast-paced story ( with a confused sense of time ) that occasionally struggles to develop its characters to their maximum potential . ultimately , this film is on par with the 1944 orson welles/joan fontaine version . jane eyre is a love story , but , instead of the lighter romance and humor of jane austen's novels , this tale is marked by stark realism and a pervasive sense of misery . the meticulously accurate settings and beautiful-but-gloomy cinematography establish the atmosphere . even the daytime scenes are drab and colorless , and many of the interior shots are so dark that it's difficult to see the characters' expressions . there's no doubt that one of the reasons jane eyre is so cheerless is because the shadows are often more important than the light . at least in the end , there is a moment of joyful catharsis . with one exception , the acting is excellent . his is a passionless portrayal of a tragic figure . the venerable joan plowright plays mrs . fairfax with grandmotherly goodwill . it's about obligations and taking responsibility for one's actions . and , most of all , it's about the maturation of an unloved girl into a sensitive woman . jane eyre features one of literature's most independent , strong-willed female protagonists in a narrative brimming with repressed emotion and dark secrets . zeffirelli's picture fits nicely into the recent spate of films based on classic novels . it's a vast improvement over last year's hack job of the scarlet letter , but not as impressive as the \" jane austen trio \" ( persuasion , sense and sensibility , and the bbc/a&e pride and prejudice ) . nevertheless , for bronte aficionados , lovers of victorian romance , or those who simply appreciate literate love stories , jane eyre offers two hours of quality entertainment .",

            "message": "nevertheless , what separates this film from the many other crime-gone-wrong pictures is that it's almost completely non-violent . there are no shoot outs , fistfights , or explosions . there is a gun , but it's used primarily as a prop . palookaville ( the title is from the classic marlon brando line in on the waterfront about losers ) is the debut feature for director alan taylor , who has used the stories of post-wwii italian author italo calvino and the 1956 comic heist movie , big deal on madonna street , as inspirations . as jerry says , \" we're not really cut out for this . some people are . palookaville opens with a jewelry store robbery gone bad -- but not in reservoir dogs fashion . it's not a very good plan -- parts are culled from the old rko movie , armored car robbery -- but they seem to think it's foolproof . one of the things that elevates palookaville over the likes of bottle rocket and things to do in denver when you're dead is its character development . although this film is sprinkled with comic moments and its tone is basically lighthearted , it treats its protagonists seriously . sid , russ , and jerry seem like real people -- losers with good hearts who want to commit crimes but lack the requisite toughness and cynicism . gallo's russ would like us to believe that he's a tough hood , but his hard personality is really a front . with an evocative score by rachel portman and cinematography by john thomas , palookaville has a feel that belies its $1 million budget . at times , the movie is funny , touching , and quirky . there are a few isolated scenes that don't work , but , in general , palookaville represents insouciant entertainment bolstered by an unforced message about not taking the \" american dream \" too seriously . after all , the people in palookaville may be losers with little hope of rising above their circumstances , but that doesn't mean they don't have hearts and souls . and , although it may appear tarantino-inspired at a glance , once you get into palookaville , you'll understand that it has a much kinder , gentler story to tell .",

( presumably , miramax is offering the horseman as an alternative for anyone seeking something with more substance than twister or mission : impossible . ) other than a few pregnant glances , these two don't share much in the way of intimacy . they don't even kiss . a little extra heat might have made for a more powerful romance -- at times , the horseman on the roof takes restraint too far . love and emotion aside , this is a wonderful spectacle , and , with all the action and adventure , it's an undeniably enjoyable romp . even those who typically shun france's more artistic fare will be entertained by this big-budget feature . not counting the subtitles , it's the kind of thing that hollywood would be proud of . there's nothing in this film that american audiences can't relate to . although much of the horseman on the roof is more lighthearted than many sweeping melodramas , there are moments of stark , horrifying power . most deal with the effects of cholera on france's unprepared populace . it's a chillingly memorable moment . this is one of the most lavish , recent french exports , and the production values are top-notch . rappeneau ( cyrano de bergerac ) directs with a sure hand , martinez and binoche do credible ( if not spectacular ) jobs , and cameos by francois cluzet and the ubiquitous gerard depardieu add a few brief moments of \" star power \" . despite all of this , however , the horseman on the roof is not a transcendent experience . but , while it doesn't have the power to get eyes misty and hearts aflutter , it's still entertaining enough to make the two hours pass quickly .",

            "message": "but it's not the first . the arrival , with a significantly lower budget than fox's july 3 release , has that distinction , and , while this particular film doesn't boast any radical or surprising ideas , it combines numerous familiar plot elements into a suspenseful , entertaining whole . best of all , perhaps , is the realization that some thought went into writer/director david twohy's script . this is not a dumb movie ; in fact , with its heavy reliance upon real science , it's startlingly credible . when aliens can disguise themselves as humans , as in the arrival , we're never sure who's a friend and who's a foe , and the best science fiction/horror films of this ilk continuously keep us guessing . conspiracy lovers will have fun sorting through the layers of cover-up and treachery here . the premise is rather simple . a colonizing force has arrived here incognito with the goal of readying this world for inhabitation . that process involves accelerating the greenhouse effect -- intentionally polluting the atmosphere so that the global temperature rises , causing the polar ice caps melt . but zane isn't the only one observing strange goings-on . the arrival is low key , which is refreshing at this time of year , and it's as much horror as pure science fiction . this is the kind of movie that a director like john carpenter might have made during his late-70s/early-80s heyday . it's creepy and atmospheric , and , after a rather protracted opening forty minutes , well-paced . spectacled and bearded , charlie sheen is surprisingly effective as the paranoid protagonist . he's more of an everyday sort of guy than a superhero , and , as a result , is easy to identify with . everyone else in the cast is basically a supporting player , including ron silver as an oily ceti executive , so the responsibility for the movie lies fully on sheen's shoulders , and he carries the burden admirably . x files fans will discover a lot worth appreciating about the arrival , which shares certain core similarities with the tv show . this film , however , takes things much further . believability is a tremendous asset in a picture like this . david twohy should be commended . in a summer when tornadoes , impossible missions , and flying dragons are grabbing the headlines and the big money , his smaller effort has shown more creativity than any of those blockbusters .",

            "message": "while the movie explores serious issues , it often does so in a playful , even comic , manner . there's a greek chorus of drag queens on hand to lip-synch old pop tunes that fit the current mood ( some of these numbers recall similar moments from the adventures of priscilla , queen of the desert ) . the script is peppered with biting one-liners and amusing anecdotes . depicted from another point-of-view , stonewall could have been a real downer . as it stands , however , finch has made this an upbeat , triumphant tale . la miranda is typical of the new york transvestite scene -- tough , hardened , and jaded . certainly , the most fascinating aspect of stonewall is its depiction of the gay culture thirty years ago . as homophobic as this nation is today , '90s views are nothing compared to those prevalent in the late-'60s . they willingly fostered the belief that homosexuality was an illness , courting pity in the hope that it would supplant hatred . stonewall is not intended to be a history lesson ; the time frame and setting are necessary to the story , but they are subordinate to the characters . some of the subplots work ; some don't . the believability of these two anchors the film , preventing stonewall from ever becoming too outrageous or seeming too preachy . we sympathize with the cause not because of rhetoric , but because we care about the characters . undoubtedly , that's one reason why this motion picture succeeds . another is that , in addition to having a heart , stonewall isn't afraid to have fun , which is a welcome change from the agenda of many grim , gay-themed motion pictures currently floating around the international film festival circuit .",

            "message": "fields , i'd rather be in philadelphia . actually , for a movie that's so precise about time ( one of the characters is constantly using a stopwatch ) , the title's a little inaccurate . unless i'm completely confused about when things started and stopped , it's not so much 2 days in the valley as it is about twenty-four hours . what we have here is actually four individual stories that occasionally intersect , often in the most odd and unpredictable of ways . one of the best aspects of 2 days in the valley is the clever manner in which the narrative has been assembled . while things aren't nearly as elaborately-connected as in pulp fiction , i like the way paths cross , characters just miss each other , and everything comes together during the climactic ten minutes . while the plot of 2 days in the valley isn't a masterpiece of intrigue or intricacy , it kept me involved and entertained , and that's about the best you can hope for from this sort of motion picture . fate intercedes , however -- but not just in teddy's life . in one way or another , the wheels of destiny bring nearly all of these characters together , although not always at the same time and in the same place . 2 days in the valley has a penchant for the outrageous , with generous helpings of dark and ironic humor . there are a number of laugh-aloud lines , but the film works best when the comedy is of the \" wink-wink-nudge-nudge \" variety . or , in one of my favorite scenes , dosmo , ever the cordial hostage-taker , offers to cook pasta for his captives . teri hatcher fans will be pleased . most everyone in the cast does a good job , but the standouts are aiello , who is hilarious as the toupeed , down-on-his-luck , dog-fearing hitman , and spader , playing against type , as his emotionless partner . i enjoyed 2 days in the valley . it's pure entertainment -- nothing too serious , nothing too deep -- with an artistic sensibility . it's rare for movies these days to recognize that their audience has an intelligence , and even more unusual for them not to talk down to us . 2 days does both . so , if you're looking for some smart fun , john herzfeld's feature is a worthy choice . and you don't need two days -- just two hours .",

            "message": "al pacino in a mafia movie feels as natural as peanut butter with jelly . mike newell , the director of such popular british comedies as enchanted april and four weddings and a funeral , is another matter altogether . when you think of a director for new york-based , mob- related motion pictures , names like brian de palma , francis ford coppola , and martin scorsese leap to mind . unexpectedly , however , newell slides effortlessly into the genre , fashioning a motion picture that is simultaneously like and unlike traditional wiseguy films . perhaps the most impressive thing that newell has done with donnie brasco is to cull an atypically low-key and introspective performance from al pacino , an actor known for manic , scenery-chewing efforts . \" 30 years , i'm bustin' my hump . . . pacino presents lefty as a tragic , and at times pathetic , character who earns our pity and understanding , if not our sympathy . there's little hint of michael corleone here -- lefty is an impotent doubter who knows how it will all end . if there are times when joe's character doesn't seem whole , the blame lies more with the script's failure to provide the needed background or motivation than with depp's performance . although donnie brasco is set against a backdrop of crime and violence ( and newell doesn't shrink from showing these elements , although he's more restrained than a scorsese might be ) , it , like many better gangster films , is really about family and relationships . as lefty says at one point , \" [the mob] is my family , even more than my [real] family . \" it's because donnie brasco focuses on characters and relationships that it makes for compelling viewing . although the film contains many of the usual mob cliches and stock secondary characters , these don't detract much from the viewer's enjoyment . truth may be stranger than fiction , but many \" based on real events \" motion pictures aren't nearly as well-executed or involving as donnie brasco . the film has all the right little touches to be believable , such as lefty's fascinating lesson to his protege about how to dress , act , and speak to be respected in wiseguy circles . donnie brasco takes us into a world that the movies frequently open to us , but somehow this trip seems more real and less glamorized than most . the result is a satisfying film going experience .",

( incidentally , by today's standards , the nude scenes of agutter wouldn't earn anything more sensational than an \" r \" . ) it's clear here , as it was in many '70s pictures , that civilized humanity is the enemy -- the scourge and rapist of nature . by today's standards , the film's message may seem a little naive , but that by no means renders it invalid . there are biblical allusions as well , such as snakes in a tiny desert oasis , but the real serpent in this eden is the industrialized society . for the most part , walkabout is an involving , occasionally hypnotic , motion picture . some of the photography , including images of the outback and its denizens , is spectacular . there are also several effective visual contrasts between man and nature , such as the sequence where agutter's character , a child of civilization , is enjoying a quiet swim in a natural pool while a group of aborigines , children of the wilderness , are curiously exploring the burnt-out shell of a car . all throughout the film , the differences between man and his world are highlighted , and the ending , which , while tragic , seems almost inevitable . not every aspect of walkabout is successful , however . roeg occasionally resorts to intrusive camera tricks to get his point across , and , without exception , these work to the film's detriment . the use of still frames , hand-held shots , and bizarre inserts interferes with the simple beauty of the film , temporarily distancing the viewer from what's transpiring . these supposedly-artistic riffs are uniformly more distracting than effective . certainly , the most fascinating aspect of walkabout is the relationship between the white children and their black guide . not so for agutter's character , a wild flower wilting under the relentless sun . there's a subtle element of sexual tension in their relationship , but it's kept in the subtext . i doubt any film made today would be as oblique about this . the climactic moment , and the different ways the three characters face it , says more about the contrast between the \" civilized \" and \" uncivilized \" than anything else in the film . it's difficult for me , reviewing walkabout more than a quarter century after its initial release , to get a sense of what the movie meant then , when its method and approach were fresher and more unique than they appear now . by 1997 , we've seen innumerable films with the same message , and that makes parts of walkabout appear outdated . nevertheless , even considering that this motion picture has not aged as well as some other landmark '70s movies , certain aspects of the film -- notably its lush , evocative photography and forceful emotional component -- make it a worthwhile experience for a '90s audience .",

            "message": "perhaps disney should take a lesson from writer/director dale rosenbloom regarding how to make a family film . shiloh , rosenbloom's first foray into the field of family entertainment , easily outclasses any live-action movie the mouseketeers have released in the last three or four years . here are some disney staples that shiloh has managed to avoid : plastic characters , ogre-like adults afflicted with terminal stupidity , moronic humor , pointless action sequences , and a nauseating overdose of cuteness . rosenbloom has remembered something that disney has forgotten : the key to fashioning good family entertainment is to make the movie enjoyable to everyone in the family , not just the five and six-year olds . will appreciate what rosenbloom has wrought with this low-key , thoughtful motion picture . he takes the time and effort to develop real , imperfect characters rather than recycling familiar types . i have never been a big fan of \" animal in danger \" tales , but shiloh is far better than most . not only does it show the animal , a one-year old beagle , being abused ( although not graphically ) , but it doesn't turn the dog into some sort of living cartoon character . and the film's villain , judd travers ( scott wilson ) , isn't just inherently evil -- there's a legitimate reason why he's so nasty , as marty comes to find out during the movie's second half . he even gives it a name -- shiloh -- after the bridge where he encountered it . the strength of shiloh is that it approaches its subject matter intelligently . the adults in shiloh are not one-dimensional . marty's dad , despite being somewhat domineering and old-fashioned , understands his son's affection for shiloh , and , to a degree , is willing to support him . everyone , from a veteran like rod steiger to a newcomer like blake heron , gives a heartfelt and believable performance . shiloh , which is adapted from a newberry award winning book , fits nicely into the class of better animal-related family films , joining the ranks of lassie and black beauty . and , while the primary target audience is undeniably children , few adults who sit through this motion picture will wish they had done otherwise . shiloh represents something that's all too rare at theaters these days : a pleasant surprise .",

            "message": "love is supposed to be one of the most wonderful things known to humanity , and hollywood has produced countless pictures that place it on the highest pedestal . but there is another kind of love -- a darker , uglier sort that rarely reaches the screen because the public , it is deemed , finds it too unpleasant . so , while most films are content to explore the lighter , romantic side of love , washington square takes a cold , hard look at the painful , destructive aspect of the same emotion . two years ago , motion pictures enjoyed a flirtation with jane austen , adapting no less than four of her novels into major motion pictures and/or television mini-series . the first , 1949's the heiress ( directed by william wyler and starring olivia de havilland , who won an oscar for her role ) , was based on a stage play version of the book that eliminated many of the more subtle aspects of james' text . the crux of catherine's dilemma isn't whether to surrender money for love -- that would be no choice , since physical pampering is largely unimportant to her . austin could easily have become a black-and-white villain , but finney's performance defies the audience's desire to label him as such . finney handles the complex motivations of his character expertly , creating a fascinating antagonist . the third major character is the most ambiguous . washington square keeps us guessing about morris' real motivations . while ben chaplin's performance is not the equal of leigh's or finney's , he is solid enough not to give away the truth about morris until the script reveals it . lest washington square seem too serious and downbeat , there's always the character of aunt livinia ( maggie smith ) on hand to provide comic relief . austin's sister , who has served as catherine's surrogate mother , delivers many of the film's most witty lines , and her presence single-handedly keeps the tone gentler than one might otherwise expect . the best thing about washington square is that it draws us into the world of the characters and challenges us to understand them and question their views and motivations . the film is emotionally effective without going overboard . director agnieszka holland ( whose previous efforts include europa europa and olivier olivier ) opts to avoid the temptation of reducing washington square to the level of a costume melodrama . her careful , modulated handling of the material makes this resemble merchant-ivory's better work ( like the remains of the day ) . washington square is faithful representation of james' text , and a moving and satisfying portrait of one woman's struggle for independence in a society where everything is defined by love , money , or both . \" for me , the cinema is not a slice of life , but a piece of cake . \"",

            "message": "walsh , e . g . marshall , david paymer , david hyde pierce director : oliver stone producers : clayton townsend , andrew g . vanja , and oliver stone screenplay : oliver stone , stephen j . rivele , and christopher wilkinson cinematography : robert richardson music : john williams u . s . distributor : hollywood pictures it's always a tricky proposition to make a motion picture based on recent history -- and the more public the episode , the more difficult it is for the film maker to balance drama with accuracy . this is especially true when that film maker is oliver stone , a director known more for self-aggrandizement than for the thoughtful handling of difficult issues . it's entirely because of stone's reputation that the even- handedness of nixon is such a surprise . while not an unassailable portrait of the late president , this movie at least attempts to present nixon as a human being , with all the failings and greatness inherent in a man of his stature . nixon is portrayed an neither demonic nor angelic . this is a rare occasion where stone's script is more concerned with executing a character study than pushing a political agenda . the film even ends with a touching tribute culled from nixon's funeral last year . that's not to say that stone has stuck entirely to the historical record . one wonders if stone didn't include this bit just to incite controversy and raise a few eyebrows . nixon is not a simple regurgitation of historical events . in fact , history is used primarily as the backdrop against which this character study takes place . less a biography than an impressionist's vision , the film may disappoint those expecting a vitriolic attack on someone who is surely not among stone's heroes . but the lead personae , as realized by anthony hopkins , isn't reduced to an unthinking , unfeeling caricature . while nixon is depicted as a paranoid , borderline-megalomaniac , he's also shown to have deep moral convictions , a strong sense of loyalty , and a love of his country . the drama plays out in a shakespearean fashion , with nixon's tragic flaw of hubris clearly in evidence . hopkins is not heavily made up -- and therefore doesn't really look like his character -- but his mannerisms are perfect and he is allowed a full range of facial expressions ( unlike robert duvall in stalin ) . hopkins does far more with acting than fake jowls could ever accomplish . the film's structure is disjointed , especially during the first hour , as the narrative skips back and forth through time from watergate to 1960 to the 1920s and 30s . stone is giving us a snapshot of nixon's life , but it comes in such a random and haphazard fashion that it dims the dramatic impact and dilutes early character development . it's not until the film's second hour , as nixon faces the dilemma of how to end the vietnam war , that hopkins' character starts to click . stone's penchant for bizarre cinematography damages the film more often than not . many of the odd camera angles , film stock switches , and surrealistic superimposed backdrops are distracting rather than effective . unfortunately , this has become one of stone's trademarks ; he seems unable to make a film without making some kind of statement to the effect of : \" look at me ! i'm an artist ! \" nixon would have been better focused without such grandstanding . there are several memorable scenes in nixon and these , along with hopkins' outstanding portrayal , keep the viewer engaged . nixon really doesn't offer any surprising insights , nor does it break new ground for the director . this is a dynamic -- if flawed -- look at the man who , for better and for worse , changed america's place in the world and its perception of itself . there are few who do not have an opinion of nixon . and , factual or not , there's no denying that nixon has moments when it is nothing short of compelling .",

            "message": "sometimes , it's impossible not to contemplate what a motion picture could have been , had a few things about it been different . often , especially for very good or very bad movies , the changes will make little difference . however , in the case of the house of the spirits , which is a worthy effort as it stands , certain alterations ( not all of which would have been simple to execute ) might have transformed this into a devastating film . alas , deficiencies rob the picture of a share of its impact , limiting the ultimate emotional appeal and power of bille august's adaptation of isabel allende's novel . the house of the spirits is driven by its complex and many-faceted plot , not by the characters that populate the film . the story moves along at a rapid pace , sometimes glossing over the more trivial events that might have bolstered the substance of the protagonists . events fly by as fast as the decades , with political activities gaining importance as the movie races towards its conclusion . many of the characters , both major and minor , are little more than ciphers for a certain point-of-view or belief . even jeremy irons' esteban remains relatively undeveloped until well into the second half , when events conspire to re-mould his previously intransigent personality , lending it depth and dimension . meryl streep's clara is one of the few characters to be well-rounded from the start , although even in her case , there is unplumbed territory--her odd psychic powers are only occasionally brought into use , and then as minor plot devices , when so much more could have been formed from that raw material . winona ryder is given perhaps her most difficult role to date , and carries it off with aplomb . in addition to that of ms . ryder , the best performances are given by ms . close , ms . streep , and mr . irons ( although it becomes something of an annoyance trying to pin down what esteban's accent is supposed to be ) . perhaps director august was constrained by running time , but his latest project shows little of the careful examination of character that his two most celebrated films--pelle the conqueror and the best intentions--exhibit . in fact , the house of the spirits is in many ways the antithesis of the best intentions . while the latter was a slow-moving piece that allowed its participants time to grow and breathe , this new film seems at times constrained and cramped . regardless of its flaws , however , the house of the spirits is an engrossing motion picture . it doesn't capitulate with the \" hollywood mentality \" that demands a complete ending , willing instead to risk something open-ended . the story attains a momentum of its own that sweeps the viewer along until the end . this movie is one-hundred forty- two minutes long , but could easily have been double that , had the screenplay demanded it . at its best , the house of the spirits interweaves the very personal story of its main characters with the turbulent political backdrop which frames their actions . bille august has done a fine job with isabel allende's tale , crafting a captivating motion picture , but it's hard not to recognize the flaws , and wonder about the lost potential .",

            "message": "richard iii -- it's shakespeare that has nothing to do with kenneth branagh . actually , at first glance , this film doesn't appear to have anything to do with the bard's play , either . opening in a 1930's england war room with a tank crashing through a wall , one is immediately struck by the realization that , whatever this movie is doing , it certainly isn't preserving the story's original time frame . however , while the sets and costumes have been moved to a mythical , nazi-like pre-wwii england , the dialogue , characters , actions , and themes remain unchanged from the original text by shakespeare . while this curious clash between a near-modern setting and the much older source material might seem confounding , it actually serves to energize the play , as well as making it more palatable to present-day audiences . being released at the same time as a new version of othello ( which has branagh , along with laurence fishburn and irene jacob ) , richard iii is likely either to usher in a new , mini-era of screen shakespeare revival , or show that two shakespeare films are capable of glutting a small marketplace . othello is a far more traditional interpretation than richard iii , and , other than authorship , about the only thing the movies have in common is that both excise significant portions of dialogue from the original text in the interest of saving time . sir ian mckellan , a veteran of screen and stage , takes the title role of richard and turns in a performance that is equal parts captivating magnetism and chilling menace . it's an amazing piece of acting that is worthy of notice at oscar nomination time . does richard have a conscience ? can evil such as his triumph completely , with no recompense expected on this side of the grave ? can the british monarchy exist without venom and corruption filtering up to the highest levels ? these are a few of the more cogent questions addressed by richard iii , and mckellan and director richard loncraine make sure that they remain intact in the final version of the film . in its own bloody way , richard iii is as enjoyable to watch as any recent screen production of shakespeare , and the shift to the 1930's with its attendant nazi imagery ( parallels between richard iii and hitler abound ) gives the film a twist that conventional productions do not have . if there's a flaw to the movie , it's that this is one of shakespeare's least ambitious and less thematically rich plays . nevertheless , since the only memorable motion picture version is lawrence olivier's 1956 version , richard iii doesn't suffer from overexposure , and this new interpretation offers an unconventional-- and easily accessible -- perspective .",

            "message": "\" it's my considered opinion that in the fullness of time , history will record the greatness of [michael] collins and it will be recorded at my expense . \" not unexpectedly , writer/director neil jordan has been obligated to affirm the picture's integrity , stating at the toronto film festival that \" most of the people who accuse me of inflaming the peace process have no interest in the peace process whatsoever . \" in truth , while michael collins does distort elements of history , most of the changes and compressions are dramatically effective . certain characters are combined , a few deaths happen differently from what history records , and events have been streamlined . the usage of such \" dramatic license \" is not uncommon in the development of reality- based movies , so it shouldn't come as a surprise that it exists in this case . perhaps the most suspect element of michael collins' script is the negative portrayal of irish hero eamon de valera . partisans of the late president will not react favorably to such speculation , even though , in the context of this narrative , it works . putting aside all the controversy , however , viewers are left with an expertly-directed and well-acted historical epic that disappoints only in its shallow perspective of the irish/british and irish/irish conflicts . this is a case where the era not only defines the character , but the character defines the era . it's impossible to tell the tale of michael collins without delving into the beginnings of the ira and the dramatic upsurge in support for sinn fein , yet there's a sense that important issues have been glossed over . however , jordan's view of characters and circumstances is remarkably even-handed -- he shows both the brutality and sensitivity of collins' nature , turning the man into the central figure of an almost-shakespearean tragedy . strong acting is a key reason why michael collins is as effective as it is . his portrayal of collins is the most passionate , powerful work he has ever done , easily eclipsing his oscar-nominated presentation of oscar schindler . for well over a decade , neeson has been carefully honing his talents , and the results are apparent here . although neeson's forceful performance drives the movie , he is assisted by an able supporting cast . alan rickman , best known for playing flamboyant villains ( die hard and kevin costner's robin hood ) gives a surprisingly low-key and introspective interpretation of de valera . and , despite a variable irish accent , julia roberts is more than capable in the small role of kitty kiernan , the woman who brings collins' human side to the fore . even for those who know the whole story of michael collins , the movie is still a riveting piece of film making , capable of holding an audience's attention for more than two hours . jordan not only does an exceptional job recreating the ireland of the 1920s , but presents us with an entirely human protagonist who's flawed yet sympathetic . collins is not the brash hero of the traditional historical epic -- he's a tormented individual who knows that his chief talent is for creating mayhem , but who wants peace so desperately that he's willing to die for it . leeson's portrayal of collins' agony during the civil war is so real that , at times , it's almost painful to watch . in tone and spirit , if not in time and place , this film shares a great deal with last year's oscar-winning braveheart . neil jordan felt that this story was so important that he nurtured the script for thirteen years until he had the clout to command the actors and budget he wanted . the ultimate result may not quite match his ambitions , but it will still be one of 1996's most talked- about motion pictures . -- ingmar bergman",

            "message": "there was a time during the long history of the adult entertainment industry that porn films showed signs of artistic ambition . during the late '70s , a small cadre of directors believed that they could combine the raunch of real sex with an involving plot . it was a lofty goal , and one that ultimately proved impossible to realize , especially with the advent of video forcing movies to be made cheaper and faster . but boogie nights isn't just an expose of the porn industry -- it's a provocative and involving character study , as well . while it could be argued that anderson has bitten off more than he can chew -- a few too many of the men and women populating his film are left half-developed -- an overambitious approach is always preferable to the alternative , and boogie nights does enough things right that it's easy to overlook its few shortcomings . one of the movie's greatest , and most immediately obvious , assets is its ability to capture the feel and mood of the late '70s and early '80s . at different times throughout the film , anderson uses long , single takes where the camera pans from one character to another , putting the viewer in the midst of a swirl of activity . the director also has a talent for picking just the right songs for each scene , making the soundtrack an integral part of the movie rather than just a jumbled collection of old disco hits . add to that the hairdos , clothing , decor , and attitudes of the era , and you have an effective re- creation of recent history . the first half of the film , which takes place between 1977 and late 1979 , is lively and energetic , with the focus on parties and good times . then , following a pivotal sequence at a 1979/80 new year's eve gathering , boogie nights' tone shifts to something more grim and contentious . the porn industry goes into a downward spiral with mass-market video supplanting carefully-made movies , and the actors and directors are sucked down with it . together , the director and his star seek to elevate the adult film to the next level ( which actually resembles a cheap exploitation action flick ) . dirk isn't the only one under jack's wing . although mark wahlberg has the starring role , and gives the best performance of his still-young career ( although there are still times when he is stiff ) , he is easily overshadowed by two more impressive portrayals . matching reynolds' performance step-by-step is julianne moore , who can add her role in boogie nights to an ever-increasing list of interesting and challenging characters . and porn icon nina hartley gets some mainstream exposure , and even a few lines , as little bill's wife . boogie nights is filled with so many subplots and secondary themes that it would be impossible to recount them all here . all of the men and women populating boogie nights encounter at least one of these elements as they traverse their character arc . boogie nights is a dramatically rich and visually arresting motion picture that has earned ( and is deserving of ) comparisons to the films of robert altman . anderson takes risks with this movie , few of which fall short . ( one of these is the pointed and sure-to-be controversial final shot -- a perfectly conceived and framed statement about the de-humanizing effects of the porn industry . ) the result is a memorably penetrating motion picture . \" the cinema is not an art which films life : the cinema is something between art and life . unlike painting and literature , the cinema both gives to life and takes from it . . . \" - jean-luc godard",

            "message": "it's a curious thing that the best 1995 adaptation of a jane austen book happens to be of her worst novel . sense and sensibility was the author's first published work and , as is often the case with early writing efforts , displays an undeniable shallowness : themes are half- developed , characterization is uneven , and plotting follows a predictable straight-forwardness . austen's later books , including persuasion , which was developed into a wonderfully sumptuous film earlier this year , and emma , which received unusual treatment in clueless , plumb the human soul far more deeply , creating characters and situations of greater versatility and vitality . that's more in the nature of literary criticism than a film review , however . sense and sensibility is a wonderful motion picture , even given the weaknesses of the source material . emma thompson's screenplay has remained faithful to the events and spirit of the book , while somehow managing to plug a few holes and infuse the tale with more light humor than is evident in austen's original text . the resulting product is a little too long ( one-hundred thirty-five minutes ) , but still represents a fine time at the movies , especially for those with a bent towards historical romantic melodramas . as mentioned above , the story isn't all that complex or surprising , and those unfamiliar with austen's work won't be left in the dark . the story of who ends up with whom , and how they get that way , is told with deft skill and a pleasantly humorous romantic touch . as is so often the case in british productions , acting is more important than the script or the impressive production values . emma thompson's elinor can join the actresses' characters from howards end , the remains of the day , and this year's carrington as examples of top- notch , finely-nuanced performances . winslet isn't as accomplished as thompson at capturing the camera's attention , but rarely is she completely eclipsed , either . as expected , the supporting cast is excellent . hugh grant brings his usual boyish charm to edward , and alan rickman ( die hard ) , too often pigeonholed into villainous roles , shows for the first time since truly , madly , deeply that he's very much at home in a romantic part . the novel's flaws guarantee that sense and sensibility cannot be a perfect motion picture , but it would be difficult , i think , to do much better with the material than emma thompson and director ang lee ( eat drink man woman ) have here . with more jane austen on the way ( versions of pride and prejudice and emma ) , it's still too early to say which adaptation will stand out as the best , but sense and sensibility makes a strong case .",

            "message": "there are two types of satire : high concept and low concept . both lampoon specific targets , but while the latter does so with more concern for belly-laughs than subtle , thought-provoking amusement , the former is often characterized by wit and intelligence . grosse fatigue , a quirky , unique product of french writer/director/actor michel blanc , is a high concept farce . during most showings of this film , smiles and chuckles - - not uncontrollable laughter -- will be in abundance . in grosse fatigue , names are precisely what have not been altered . in grosse fatigue as in life , blanc is a famous french movie maker/actor . bouquet is a glamorous actress and noiret is the suave , cultured man who graced international screens in cinema paradiso and the postman . only a special sort of director would dare take such obvious jabs at his own celebrity status , and part of grosse fatigue's appeal is that this film plays off egos rather than pandering to them . as has been expected of satires since the player , the movie features several cameos . actresses mathilda may and charlotte gainsbourg , and director roman polanski all make appearances . and , while they never show up in the flesh , icons gerard depardieu and emanuelle beart are the targets of several verbal ripostes . yet , even though many of the in-jokes refer to french cinema , familiarity with france and its movies is not mandatory to enjoy grosse fatigue . the premise , which demands a fair ( but not unreasonable ) level of suspended disbelief , postulates what might happen if a famous person had a double , and that double chose to masquerade as the star . by the time blanc figures out what's going on and decides to take action , it may already be too late . blanc has been referred to as france's woody allen , and the script for grosse fatigue is sprinkled with the kind of comedy and insight the new york based film maker is famous for . although the movie is occasionally hamstrung by technical limitations ( a poor score being the most obvious example ) , superb writing and solid acting make up for the few faults . thematically , the picture delves into such diverse ( and weighty ) topics as the nature of fame and personal identity , and the decline of the french film industry in the face of an all-out onslaught from hollywood . in the way it toys with reality and fantasy , grosse fatigue is a fascinating exploration of life as seen through the eyes of a perceptive and humorous director . blanc never allows his film to degenerate into a series of pointless jokes , but the serious side is also kept at bay . grosse fatigue is smart in both script and approach , and this makes for a lighthearted ninety minutes where turning off the thinking portions of the brain is not a prerequisite to enjoyment .",

            "message": "the joy luck club , as stated in the movie's opening narrative , is a collection of four aging chinese women bound together more by hope than by joy or luck . since i didn't count , i can't verify this statement , but it sounds about right . taken as a whole , all of these vignettes combine to lend greater meaning to the whole . the joy luck club is the sum total of its parts with common themes giving solid grounding and greater resonance to the overall film . as bass comments , \" i saw all the mothers' and daughters' stories as facets of the same experience . that's the genius of the book , and if we cut it down to just a couple of stories it would be like any other movie . \" the stories are not told in such a manner as to seem pared down or truncated , nor is their presentation confusing , thanks to a cleverly- orchestrated framing scene with the principal characters gathered together . however , it is apparent that a lot more could have been told , and we're left wondering about all that we didn't get to see . the characters are mostly well-developed , but it's tantalizing to consider just how much fuller some of them could have been with a different plot structure . but there are always sacrifices to be made , and no movie can tell everything about the lives of the people it introduces . one of the themes of sleepless in seattle is that there are some \" guy movies \" and some \" chick movies . \" if this is true , then the joy luck club fits into the latter category . certainly , a tear-jerker like this is likely to find more open acceptance among women than among men . that's not necessarily because men won't like it , but some will be too embarrassed to admit that they enjoyed something as emotional as this . in fact , there are those who may refuse to see it to avoid this possible dilemma altogether . nevertheless , there will be a group of people who will genuinely dislike the joy luck club , and i can't say that their reasoning is entirely flawed . the movie has a few moments that can justifiably be described as cloying and manipulative , and those who are offended by these methods are going to become annoyed at the joy luck club . die-hard cynics are advised to stay clear . what the aforementioned people have missed , however , is that the scenes that don't work are far fewer in number than those that do , and most of these can easily be overlooked in piecing together the overall intent of the motion picture . few movies are without at least a problem or two , and it's more difficult to put together a flawless production when going for the emotional payoffs that this film does . the joy luck club is clearly--perhaps too clearly--an adaptation of a book . the dialogue is often too poetic to be real , and the story too clearly plotted to be acceptable as anything more than an imperfect reflection of the world we live in . i hasten to add that this is not a bad thing , but it is evidence that this movie , through its willingness to loosen the strings of realism , expects a certain suspension of disbelief from the audience . personally , i never identified with any of the characters , but i became involved in their stories . that is to say , never did i make a connection between something in my own life and what i was seeing on screen , but that in no way diminished the impact of what was being presented . i venture to say that many women , especially those who have had tempestuous relationships with their mothers or daughters , will have an entirely different viewpoint . the line between drama and melodrama is a fine one , and most of the joy luck club successfully navigates the tightrope , staying on the more powerful dramatic side . there are times when it slips and comes across as heavy-handed . you know something isn't right when it becomes apparent that certain lines of dialogue and character actions are trying desperately to make you , as a member of the audience , shed a tear . whether or not these incidents do what they're trying to is another matter entirely . . . . wayne wang , whose best-known previous film was dim sum , shows significant ability in the way he has structured this movie . many are played by more than one actor ( as children then adults , for example ) , but all changes are smooth and seamless . it's as easy to accept a little girl as waverly as it is the beautiful , sophisticated-looking tamlyn tomita , and that's because the characters transcend the performers portraying them . it's fascinating and satisfying the way that the diverse threads are knitted together into a single tapestry . some might complain that this movie is a downer , but those who do , fail to recognize that the joy luck club's message is one of hope , and that catharsis and emotional fulfillment often come through tragedy . sure , a lot of bad things happen during the course of this film , but at the end , the tears are of happiness and new beginnings , not loss .",

            "message": "one of the most disturbing elements of any organized protest of this sort is that most of those involved will not have seen the picture in question . another equally unfortunate byproduct is that , as was the case with the last temptation of christ , the movie itself may get lost somewhere in the resulting polarization . if that happens , it will be a shame , because priest has a lot to say , and doesn't deserve to be hamstrung by those who miss the point or have no idea what they're talking about . there is nothing in priest that hasn't appeared in recent newspaper accounts , which makes the catholic league's opposition to the film somewhat ludicrous , not to mention hypocritical . perhaps they feel threatened by priest's depiction of men of the cloth as flawed human beings rather than as icons . certainly , the men who don the collar here are not perfect , but neither are they lunatics , epicureans , or devils . jimmy mcgovern's script does an excellent job of dovetailing the two main elements of the film--greg's homosexuality and lisa's sexual abuse--into a compelling whole , often using unexpected bursts of humor to keep the level of tension from becoming too intense . arguably , the more stirring story centers on the priest's battles with his conscience over how to help lisa , but this film wouldn't have the same emotional resonance without the other pieces . in fact , the final scene incorporates several threads into a moment that , while perhaps a little overdone , is nonetheless powerful . at its core , however , is the question of absolute certainty versus faith . there is , of course , no answer to most of the questions that greg agonizes over , but these--such as how christ could expect him to keep silent when that silence condemns a girl to continued suffering--are presented for the audience's consideration . provocative films like priest rarely arrive without creating some sort of controversy . by not compromising her vision ( which is similar to that of fellow british film maker ken loach ) , director antonia bird has fashioned a picture that not only stirs up a hornet's nest of timely and volatile spiritual issues , but faces up to homosexuality and incest with a frankness which few films dare . priest is effective not only because of all the ground it traverses , but because the final turn brings closure without excess .",

            "message": "it's interesting to note that two of the best films i've seen theatrically in 1996 weren't made this year . in fact , they weren't even made this decade . the first , martin scorsese's classic , taxi driver , is celebrating its twentieth anniversary . championed by scorsese , this re- release was handled by miramax films , which has brought back to the screen one of the greatest suspense thrillers ever to be filmed . purple noon is an autopsy of a near-perfect crime , and a compelling look at the man who commits it . the fee for the job is $5000 , but , once tom becomes involved in phillippe's life , its seductive leisure entices him away from his original goal -- or so it seems . this is all really setup , because the meat of the story reveals that tom is , in fact , an amoral killer , willing to do just about anything to get what he wants . tom is without remorse ; the only emotion he displays is satisfaction at the success of his latest caper . the plot , which is a wonderfully twisty affair filled with ingenious turns , is a delight to watch as it unfolds . nothing about this movie is pedantic or predictable ; it's two hours of pure suspense that puts many of the recent so-called \" thrillers \" to shame . it's a masterful effort by director clement , and , considering the nature of the main character , it's not hard to understand why scorsese would lend his name to the re-release ( much as he did for belle du jour ) . one of purple noon's most obvious assets is delon's acting . tom is fascinating because delon makes him so . this isn't a run-of-the-mill villain ; he's a complex character with a well thought-out reason for everything he does . he may be a psychopath , but there's a quality about him that engrosses and seduces us even as his actions cause repulsion . and , because the movie centers on tom , there are times when we find ourselves hoping that his schemes will work , if only for the pleasure of seeing what he will do next . in addition to delon's fine performance , purple noon is characterized by expert camerawork and crisp direction . clement understands how to sustain tension without drawing it out too far . the film is exactly the right length , as are each of the individual scenes . cinematographer henri decae has composed each of his shots carefully , including a masterful series of closeups of delon's eyes that reveal the sinister intelligence behind the apparently-guileless exterior . with twisters and independence days packing theaters and grabbing headlines , it's easy to bemoan the current state of cinema . so far , 1996 has not been a particularly good year for movies . there's nothing so engrossing as watching a truly intelligent thriller , and that makes this film a rare treat .",

( quentin is an admitted leonard fan ; in fact , his next directorial effort may be an adaptation of the author's rum punch . ) and \" i . e . \" on another occasion , chili lectures martin on the importance of a stare . the ending is a little reminiscent of that of the player , with a couple of big name cameos . it's a clever way to conclude a wonderfully entertaining romp . get shorty may indeed be 1995's pulp fiction , but this less profane film is likely to find wider acceptance . it's certainly more mainstream , but , at least in this case , that's not a bad thing . with get shorty , sonnenfeld has shown that broad appeal doesn't necessarily equate with stupidity . that's a lesson hollywood should learn .",

            "message": "the sweet hereafter is film maker atom egoyan's most compelling movie to date . amplifying many of the themes explored in his previous outing , exotica , the canadian director/writer/producer shows the powerful effects of grief and anger on a community devastated by an unspeakable tragedy . during the course of this 110-minute , emotionally- turbulent experience , egoyan doesn't ask any easy questions or propose any pat answers . this is film making at its most powerful : drama capable of shaking the soul , yet free of even the slightest hint of manipulation , sentimentality , or mawkishness . the movie has an impact that extends far beyond the walls of a movie theater ? a quality shared by a distressingly few of today's releases . egoyan began making films with 1984's next of kin , a critical success that earned him a nomination for canada's best director genie award . he followed next of kin with family viewing , speaking parts , the adjuster , and calendar , all of which shared certain common traits , including a wildly elliptical style , themes of emotional isolation , and a degree of distance between the characters and the audience . egoyan's early movies , although intellectually stimulating and fascinating to observe from a critical standpoint , were emotionally dissatisfying . however , the director's next effort , the much-lauded exotica , broke down the character/audience barrier , and , at the time , proved to be egoyan's most challenging effort . yet , as forceful as exotica was , it was only an appetizer for the sweet hereafter . as with all of the other egoyan-directed movies , the sweet hereafter involves more than one storyline , although the internal connections are less oblique here than in the previous features . this could easily be viewed as egoyan's most commercial work thus far . it is certainly his most accessible . there are those who would equate words like \" commercial \" and \" accessible \" with the term \" creative compromise , \" but nothing could be further from the truth . although egoyan's methods may have become more mainstream , his message is richer and more complex than ever . the scene of the bus sinking into the water ? a stark , simple shot ? is one of the most painfully effective and disturbing sequences in any film this year . the impact is further enhanced by presenting the fatal moment from the perspective of an impotent father . death has become such a cheap , bloody commodity in modern movies that viewing a scene like this is a revelation . since egoyan eschews linear storytelling by allowing time to be fluid rather than fixed , we don't see the actual accident until midway through the movie . the sweet hereafter is based on the novel by russell banks , but egoyan has infused it with his own inimitable style . the most intriguing character is mitchell . the best-developed of all of the sweet hereafter's numerous multifaceted individuals , mitchell proves to be a sympathetic figure even though his influence is negative . as always , egoyan has assembled a top-notch cast . ian holm paints a powerful and stirring portrait of mitchell as a haunted , hurting figure whose inner torment touches our hearts . it is during this scene , more than any other , that the audience truly connects with a character that , under other circumstances , might be worthy of disdain . most of the other performers are egoyan regulars . in addition to portraying nicole , polley contributes the vocals to many of the songs heard throughout the film , including the one that plays over the closing credits . one of the many tangential aspects of the sweet hereafter is to illustrate the shallowness of the numerous john grisham movies . compared to egoyan's thoughtful and potent examination of the role of a lawyer in society , even the rainmaker , the best adaptation of a grisham novel to date , seems flat and unconvincing . egoyan has given us a powerful motion picture that resonates on every level . the most amazing thing about the sweet hereafter is not the style , the acting , or the cinematography ( all of which are exceptional ) , but the way the film successfully juggles so many themes , persuading us to reflect upon them all before the 110 minute running time is up . this is truly a great film ? easily one of 1997's best . \" for me , the cinema is not a slice of life , but a piece of cake . \"",

kurosawa and shinobu hashimoto based on the stories \" rashomon \" and \" in a grove \" by ryunosuke akutagawa cinematography : kazuo miyagawa music : fumio hayasaka u . s . distributor : r . k . o . it wouldn't be a stretch to name legendary japanese film maker akira kurosawa as one of the ten greatest motion picture directors of all time . kurosawa's brilliant work speaks for itself , and , with over five decades of movie making to his credit , he has more than earned his place alongside the likes of alfred hitchcock , ingmar bergman , martin scorsese , and anyone else who belongs in such lofty company . and , like all of the best directors , kurosawa did not produce his movies with an elite audience in mind . though always intelligent , his body of work plays as well to the \" average \" movie-goer as it does to the true cineaste . that's the reason why hollywood has plundered kurosawa's pictures on a regular basis . his the seven samurai was remade into one of the greatest westerns ever -- the magnificent seven . and rashomon's unique approach to divergent narratives became a linchpin for courage under fire . rashomon , made in 1950 , was the pair's fifth movie together , and the film that first garnered kurosawa widespread international attention ( it won the 1952 best foreign language film oscar ) . the story told by rashomon is both surprisingly simple and deceptively complex . in each of the four versions of the story , the characters are the same , as are many of the details . but much is different , as well . the only \" impartial \" witness , the woodcutter , weaves a story that intertwines elements of the other three , leaving the viewer wondering if he truly saw anything at all . many people watch rashomon with the intent of piecing together a picture of what really occured . however , the accounts are so divergent that such an approach seems doomed to futility . rashomon isn't about determining a chronology of what happened in the woods . it's not about culpability or innocence . instead , it focuses on something far more profound and thought-provoking : the inability of any one man to know the truth , no matter how clearly he thinks he sees things . perspective distorts reality and makes the absolute truth unknowable . all of the narrators in rashomon tell compelling and believable stories , but , for a variety of reasons , each of them must be deemed unreliable . it's impossible to determine to what degree their versions are fabrications , and how many discrepancies are the result of legitimate differences in points-of-view . and the impressions of the \" impartial \" observer further muddy the waters , because , despite his protestations that he doesn't lie , we trust his tale the least . in the end , we are left recognizing only one thing : that there is no such thing as an objective truth . kurosawa's most brilliant move in rashomon is never to reveal what really happened . every time i watch the film , i come away with a slightly different opinion of what transpired in the woods . but not knowing remains a source of fascination , not one of frustration , and therein lies kurosawa's greatest achievement . it's worth saying something about the style employed by the director . the tone and approach of rashomon are radically different from anything western viewers are likely to be familiar with . the film is presented almost as visual poetry , paying a great deal of attention to sights and images while sound and dialogue have lesser importance . the cinematography is singularly evocative . it would be possible to watch rashomon without subtitles and still capture more than a small fraction of its essence . likewise , this film could have probably been equally successful during the silent era . as has been true throughout his entire career , kurosawa draws the best performances out of his actors . as the brash rogue at the center of the controversy , toshiro mifune is wonderfully robust . that's the brilliance of kurosawa's vision and mifune's performance . equally good is masayuki mori as the doomed noble . once again , the differences serve to emphasize that this is the same person seen from different perspectives . the most striking portrayal , however , belongs to the radiant machiko kyo , whose mesmerizing , seductive character varies the most from narrative to narrative . today , nearly fifty years after it was made , rashomon has lost none of its fascination or power . it's still a marvelous piece of cinema that asks unanswerable questions of great import . films like courage under fire may capture some of the spirit of rashomon , but no movie before or since has presented these issues in quite the same unique and intense fashion . in every sense of the word , this is a true classic . it's hard to find a more rewarding way to spend ninety minutes . - ingmar bergman",

            "message": "sleuth , a 1972 \" thinking person's thriller , \" is a rich , engaging motion picture with surprises lurking in the shadows behind every narrative corner . it's a perfect metaphor for all that is to come , as the two men square off in a series of increasingly- desperate games . this is the kind of movie where the payoff isn't about getting to the end , but in savoring every moment on the long , winding trip that takes us there . this is essentially a two-man stage show transformed into a movie . with the exception of a brief showing by british thespian alec cawthorne , the only actors on screen are olivier and caine . both are so good that there's not a moment when we wish for someone else to interrupt their duel . never has such seemingly limited one-on-one interaction been so arresting . olivier is universally recognized as one of the best actors ever to grace the screen ( big or small ) . whether as heathcliffe in wuthering heights , darcy in pride and prejudice , the lead in hamlet , moriarty in the seven per cent solution , or lord marchmain in \" brideshead revisited , \" olivier never disappointed . sleuth is easily one of his meatiest roles -- a chance to let go and act with relish . andrew wyke is a petty snob , but olivier makes him into a figure of both great humor and great tragedy . while we never sympathize with andrew , we do something far more important -- we understand him . olivier received one of his ten career acting oscar nominations for his work in this film , and , while it would be hyperbole to call this his most impressive outing , it's certainly one of his most memorable . michael caine's career has been somewhat more checkered than olivier's . nevertheless , while one might question the man's motives for appearing in certain films , there's no doubting his talent , and it's all on display in sleuth . but , as a result of andrew's cruelty , we soon recognize there's steel beneath milo's mild-mannered exterior . the brilliance of caine's portrayal is that we accept and believe every small transformation of personality that milo undergoes . at this point , i want to insert a warning into this review : because it's virtually impossible to discuss sleuth in any detail without giving away some of the surprises , i'm cautioning readers who want a \" virgin \" experience to stop reading now ( and come back once you've seen the movie ) . while my intention is not to reveal everything ( the ending , for example , will go unmentioned ) , certain plot elements will be exposed . and , while sleuth can easily be enjoyed by those who know the story inside out , why spoil some of the fun if you haven't already seen it ? to milo , it sounds like the perfect plan . there's only one problem ? andrew isn't serious . milo proves that not only is he a player of andrew's caliber , but he's faster , less principled , and more shrewd . by the time the end credits roll , it's clear who has had the final laugh . the viewer sits enraptured through the entire match between these two players , watching a series of unexpected plot twists unravel on-screen . the labyrinth at the beginning is indeed an apt metaphor . it's easy enough to guess that sleuth began life on the stage ? the narrative , with its limited setting ( most of the action takes place within a few rooms in andrew's house ) and focus on dialogue and character interaction is the kind of approach one would expect from a play . but it's hard to imagine that any live version could have been as riveting without olivier and caine , who elevate sleuth from the level of a rollicking good story to a masterpiece . here , the acting is the key , and it is never found lacking . of course , i don't mean to downplay the contribution of director joseph mankiewicz or playwright/screenwriter andrew shaffer , both of whom share credit with the actors for sleuth's success . shaffer's script is delicious ? witty , intelligent , and full of the unexpected . and , while olivier certainly has all the best lines , caine has the most glorious non-dialogue moments , such as the scene in which he dresses up as a clown in preparation for breaking into andrew's house . those who enjoyed the convolutions in david fincher's the game will find that sleuth offers many of the same pleasures without the most obvious drawback ( blatant manipulation of the audience ) . this tremendously entertaining motion picture is as effective today , more than a quarter of a century after its release , as it was in 1972 . it's not the easiest movie to find on videotape ( although it has just been released in the new dvd format ) , and many of the existing copies are in poor condition , but it's more than worth the effort to seek out . \" my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . \" -- david puttnam",

            "message": "cast : philippe noiret , salvatore cascio , marco leonardi , jacques perrin , antonella attili , pupella maggio , agnese nano , leopoldo trieste director : giuseppe tornatore producers : franco cristaldi , giovanna romagnoli screenplay : giuseppe tornatore cinematography : blasco giurato music : ennio morricone u . s . distributor : miramax films in italian with subtitles if you love movies , it's impossible not to appreciate cinema paradiso , giuseppe tornatore's heartwarming , nostalgic look at one man's love affair with film , and the story of a very special friendship . affecting ( but not cloying ) and sentimental ( but not sappy ) , cinema paradiso is the kind of motion picture that can brighten up a gloomy day and bring a smile to the lips of the most taciturn individual . light and romantic , this fantasy is tinged with just enough realism to make us believe in its magic , even as we are enraptured by its spell . most of cinema paradiso is told through flashbacks . he would abscond with the milk money to buy admission to a matinee showing at the local theater , a small place called the cinema paradiso . raised on an eclectic fare that included offerings from such diverse sources as akira kurosawa , jean renoir , john wayne , and charlie chaplin , salvatore grew to appreciate all kinds of film . cinema paradiso's first half , with salvatore cascio playing the young protagonist , is the superior portion . the boy's experiences in the theater , watching movies and listening to alfredo's stories , form a kind of journey of discovery . as salvatore cultivates his love of movies , those in the audience are prodded to recall the personal meaning of film . it's an evocative and powerful experience that will touch lovers of motion pictures more deeply than it will casual movie-goers . once salvatore has grown into his teens , cinema paradiso shifts from being a nostalgic celebration of movies to a traditional coming-of- age drama , complete with romantic disappointment and elation . the screen kiss is important to cinema paradiso . the priest no longer goes to the movies and kisses aren't censored . it's perhaps the greatest montage of motion picture kisses ever assembled , and , as salvatore watches it , tears come to his eyes . it's a profoundly moving moment -- one of many that cinema paradiso offers . is cinema paradiso manipulative ? manifestly so , but tornatore displays such skill in the way he excites our emotions that we don't care . this film is sometimes funny , sometimes joyful , and sometimes poignant , but it's always warm , wonderful , and satisfying . cinema paradiso affects us on many levels , but its strongest connection is with our memories . we relate to salvatore's story not just because he's a likable character , but because we relive our own childhood movie experiences through him . there has always been a certain magic associated with the simple act of projecting a movie on a screen . tornatore taps into this mystique , and that , more than anything else , is why cinema paradiso is a great motion picture .",

            "message": "berlinger and sinofsky painstakingly chronicle ten months worth of developments , illustrating how easily justice can be swayed . there's no way that this movie can answer the question of the defendants' guilt or innocence , but one piece of information is clear from paradise lost : jessie misskelly , damien echols , and jason baldwin did not receive fair trials . because damien was \" different \" by his own admission -- he wore black , listened to metallica , and had shown interest in the wicca religion -- he made an excellent target . berlinger and sinofsky have obtained an amazingly in-depth and intimate picture of the situation . as a result , there are no faceless entities here -- all of the participants have personalities . suddenly , the documentarians were no longer detached observers , but participants . and , while it's unlikely that their \" contribution \" affected the outcome , it's impossible to say for certain . ultimately , however , when you consider the nature of paradise lost's main concerns , this matter is of secondary importance . arthur miller's the crucible , which is due in theaters this fall , offers the salem witch trials as a parallel to mccarthyism . paradise lost shows that witch hunts didn't end centuries , or even decades , ago . the mere hint of satanism doomed their cases , even if their only real crimes were listening to heavy metal music , wearing strange clothing , and holding unconventional beliefs . there's much about these three that we'll never know , but the scary thing is that the men and women of west memphis don't care about those gaps . truth has become far less important than closure . and it doesn't matter that , if these boys are innocent , the real killers are still free . no documentary released in 1996 challenges an audience the way this one does . the questions it proposes are profound , and there are no answers . paradise lost is one of a very few films that completely absorbs the attention . watching berlinger and sinofsky's movie is like witnessing an execution : it's horrifying , gut-wrenching , and impossible to turn away from . paradise lost is the kind of film that will leave even the most devout defendants of the legal system either shaken or shaking their heads . -- ingmar bergman",

            "message": "the crown jewel of 1995's summer blockbusters appears to have arrived early . it's hard to imagine any motion picture released between now and august matching mel gibson's braveheart for spectacle . with its clashing armies , heartstopping action , and grand sense of romance , this is the sort of film it's a pleasure to see and review . let me state my preferences up front . i'm a big fan of the epic adventure , a category in which braveheart , like cream , rises to the top . there's a lot in this film that's praiseworthy--not the least of which is its ambition . those viewing this picture may be easily reminded of gettysburg , the last of the mohicans , glory , and such classics as lawrence of arabia , el cid , and spartacus . the grandeur is certainly present ; nevertheless , gibson gives us not only memorable battles , but characters of real substance . borrowing from masters like sam peckinpah and david lean , the actor/director has crafted an exceptional cinematic tapestry in only his sophomore effort . most of the time , three hour movies have a few flat spots , but braveheart is constantly on the move--riveting from start to finish . when the end credits began to roll , i was hard pressed to accept that nearly 170 minutes had elapsed . the title character is william wallace ( gibson ) , a hero of scottish history whose legend has surely outstripped fact ( in its own unique way , the film acknowledges this ) . braveheart builds slowly to its first gritty climax . their courtship is unhurried , yet this is all preparation . patrick henry once said , \" give me liberty , or give me death ! \" that might well be wallace's motto . \" it's all for nothing if you don't have freedom ! \" bulked up and wearing a long-haired wig , gibson brings his usual wealth of charisma to the title role . his edward the longshanks exudes an aura of cold menace . he's a worthy foe for wallace because his intelligence matches his ruthlessness . sophie marceau , the french actress who plays princess isabelle , and catherine mccormack are both immensely appealing . braveheart is a brutal , bloody motion picture , but the violence is not gratuitous . the maimings , decapitations , and other assorted gruesome details make wallace's world seem real and immediate . in addition , few theatrical moments make a more eloquent statement against war than when gibson shows women and children weeping over the dead on a body-littered battlefield . war is a two-headed beast , and both faces--the glorious and the tragic--are depicted . lately , certain films have come in pairs : two robin hoods , two columbuses , two earps , and now two highlander epics . rob roy , the first , is a fine motion picture . braveheart , however , is better , offering an exhilarating , and occasionally touching , experience that has viewers leaving the theater caught up in an afterglow of wonder . these days , heros like william wallace are as rare as motion picture displays of this high , uncompromising quality .",

            "message": "some concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning , a live-action version of mr . magoo being a prime example . the cartoon figure mr . magoo , the bumbling blind man , can be quite funny , but only in small doses and only within the confines of animated images . if you think naked gun star leslie nielsen is a dubious choice to play the role of the short guy who runs into walls , you are right , but there is an even more astonishing selection . mayhem then ensues as the bad and the good guys chase each other with mr . magoo frequently oblivious to the fact that anyone is being chased . like home alone 3 but without any class , mr . magoo can only be described as painfully bad . fifteen minutes of it feels like an eternity . the movie's humor is pathetically lame , and the pacing is way off . when one is stuck in a theater for an hour and a half watching what claims to be a motion picture , one looks for some solace . mr . magoo provides only three such moments . the movie begins and ends with the classic cartoon version of the character , who exudes his usual charm . the only other saving grave in the movie itself is angus , the sweet little bulldog . angus demonstrates more genuine emotions and a wider acting range than any of the humans in the picture . finally , the ending credits contain outtakes of the movie , which have some of the genuineness and spontaneity that the movie badly lacked . rather than attempt to adapt mr . magoo to a non-cartoon movie , nielsen makes the strategic mistake of trying to literally be a human version of the cartoon . he has trouble sustaining the squinting eyes and the affected voice , and even when he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny . my wife managed to get some sleep during the movie , but i was not so lucky . hopefully , this picture will force producers to think harder about which subjects have promise and which do not . it is rated pg for comic violence and would be acceptable for all ages . my son jeffrey , age 8 , said he thought the movie was good and really funny , but recommends you not choose it if you want an action movie . he said he liked home alone 3 much more . his friend maxim , age 9 , said that he thought it was good but very silly and parts did not make sense . his other friend nickolas , age 8 , said he'd give the movie * * * 1/2 , but that it was really silly .",

            "message": "my giant is two movies for the price of one , but neither is worth the cost of admission , even if you get in free . as lamely directed by michael lehmann , the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book . languidly paced throughout , the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer ( the omen ) meanders toward its sad ending . since it's rarely funny or convincingly dramatic , what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery . other than a few nice visuals , there's nothing to recommend the picture . surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there . perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success . or maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie's somber tone . the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day . this one-joke movie's single idea is to place real-life basketball player gheorghe muresan , who stands seven and a half feet tall , into as many visually striking situations as possible . and although he doesn't like it , he's willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half-dozen dwarfs . ( the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever . ) after a series of missed opportunities , the comedic part of the movie is over , and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie . to be fair , the movie does contain a few good scenes - all of which you can see in the trailers . my giant runs too long even at just 1 : 37 . it is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up . my son jeffrey and his friend matthew , both 9 , gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it . matthew pointed out that it \" is not as good as it could have been or should have been . \" he went on to comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in the middle . jeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was .",

( \" i'm optimistic by nature . i'm optimistic about nothing . \" we learn more details about francis's makeup techniques than about the man himself . mistaking francis's picture of a toilet for the genuine article , he urinates on it and then crawls back into bed contentedly . like a parody of a bad art house movie , love is the devil has horrid characters filmed bizarrely and confusingly by a director who is much more interested in technique than storytelling . by the end , the audience hasn't learned any more than it could have in a three-minute sketch . the film is not rated but should be considered nc-17 for violence , profanity , graphic sex , nudity and sadomasochism and is unacceptable for most teenagers .",

( you can almost hear the director screaming , \" get him off my set ; he's not whimsical . \" ) perhaps most offensive is the story's attitude toward smoking . it is way cool . you half expected to see a joe camel ad in the closing credits . it used after sex and even instead of sex -- complete with heavy , erotic panting . to complement the film's painfully slow pacing , the unrelenting music by terence blanchard and miles goodman has a staccato piano that will begin to feel like water torture . i felt like the music was trying brainwash me into believing the film's drivel through the music's repetitive romantic rhythms , which had all of the charm of a stuck record needle . \" surrounded by rude french people should bring us closer together . \" with dialog like this why did the producers go forward with this project ? the movie needs a rewrite and a new director . the cast would work if it had reasonable material . 'til there was you runs 1 : 44 . the film is rated pg-13 for language , sexual suggestions and drug references . the picture is remarkably tame and would be fine for kids 10 and over , but why bother ? i recommend you avoid the film , and i give it a single star for a good cast trapped in awful movie . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

( my watch and i got to know each other better as a way for me to relive my boredom . ) the result of this excessive flitting is liable to be nausea and confusion among the audience , which is a shame since there is a clever story trying to get out . but with the strobe light effect of five dozen 1-2 second clips in a row , it is hard to pay attention to anything . the only real reasons for seeing the picture are the bleak production design by george liddle and patrick tatopoulos and the grimy cinematography by dariusz wolski . for those of you who thought tim burton's vision of gotham city in batman was too bright and happy , you'll like the look of dark city . it's that loss of memory thing . ) liz keogh's costumes for the strangers are memorable . dressed in long black coats , wide brimmed black hats and big black gloves , their pancake make-up keeps them ever ready for halloween . if the editing and the confusing direction have you ready to walk out in the first fifteen minutes , don't fight the urge . yes , there are a couple of nice twists along the way and some good visuals , but most people can find many better things to do with their time . it is rated r for violence , nudity and profanity and would be fine for most teenagers .",

            "message": "quite a lot actually , in writer and director stefan ruzowitzky's morality tale , the inheritors ( die siebtelbauern ) , set in a 1930's austria that looks like the 1730s . the setup concerns the effect of the owner's will . not some noble gesture , his bequest is done as a kind of a lark , and he says in the will that he expects them to fight among themselves . the formula film rigidly dichotomizes the local inhabitants into the good and the bad . the bad can be just as easily recognized . they are the farmers with their abundant girth and black , somber suits , hats and ties . the farmers get lines certain to draw our wrath . the characters lack much depth or complexity . made in interchangeable parts , the peasants are downtrodden and hence worthy of our sympathy . it is all rather like vaudeville plays in which they hold up \" applause \" and \" hiss \" signs to instruct the audience on how they are supposed to feel when the various characters are on stage . as a director , stefan ruzowitzky strives to set a whimsical tone , but his script doesn't provide much humorous material to back up his intentions . the problem with this and other similar scenes is that the characters are not genuine enough for us to care as we should . lacking much complexity , the movie exists on scenes like the recurring one around the large kitchen table . ultimately it isn't what happens in the inheritors that is the problem , but what doesn't . the story is so thin that it is barely there , and the formula film runs most of the time on autopilot . the film isn't rated but would be an r for sex , nudity , violence , profanity and rape and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are older and mature .",

            "message": "coyote ugly is a romantic comedy produced by jerry bruckheimer . enough said ? the film is one long sexual tease that flaunts the mpaa rules . showgirls was nc-17 , but coyote ugly comes in at just pg-13 since the women keep their skimpy clothes on . this means that lots of preteens will discover wet t-shirts and provocative dances , maybe inspiring some to grow up and become exotic dancers . the picture is directed by david mcnally , whose previous work was herding lobsters who were advertising beer in the most popular commercial at the 1999 super bowl . okay , let's put the rating argument aside for the moment . \" even if you're not sure , start spraying . \" coyotes are women too wild to work at hooters . gina wendkos's script is full of such gems . another is that violet can only sing when no one is there or when the lights are out . generally , however , they dance as seductively as possible in cheesy , little outfits . they should have premiered the movie at hugh hefner's playboy mansion . this whole subplot is a throwaway designed to kill time between the erotic dance numbers . the lovers never take their clothes off so that the movie can keep its coveted pg-13 rating . this is pretty insulting to the audience's intelligence since the bar scenes push limits left and right . the thin plot , which makes soap operas seem profound in comparison , has an utterly predictable conclusion . it's really just a music video brought to the big screen in order to rake in the big bucks . for adults desperately searching for any guilty pleasure they can find , this may be the movie for them . officially it is rated pg-13 for sensuality . it would be acceptable for older teenagers .",

( this much nudity so early in a picture is not a good sign . ) the script likes to include advice , witty and bawdy . the movie has the potential to become a camp classic . although the costumes look authentic , especially the ridiculous eight-inch platform shoes that the courtesans wear , the simple make-up looks exactly like what you see on the street today . she has a book published of her poetry and engages the men in duels of poetry , sometimes lewd but more often not . as absurd as it is at times , the movie , directed by marshall herskovitz from the tv series \" my so-called life , \" can be quite cute . and with its full plate of romance , jealousy , humor , titillation and even a bit of pathos , it tries to please everyone . but the ending scene , which you've seen a hundred times before , neatly wraps it all up . although parts of the picture are enjoyable , the characters never rise above playacting . like some ribald tale from the playboy channel but with most of the sex scenes edited out , the movie is never sure what it wants to be . it's certainly not soft porn , but neither is it is very substantial . it is rated r for nudity , sex and profanity and would be acceptable for teenagers if they are both older and mature .",

( and on the aforementioned excellent piece of acting in the central role of the boy . ) landing at a random place and time in the future , they get to fight giant spiders like , but not nearly as believable as , the insects in starship troopers . there is a great scene for kids in which will uses a cool looking holographic interface to battle the bugs remotely . the main failing in the picture is not the pathetic script but instead is the way they blow it with the robot . the endearing hunk of junk of the original television series starts off life in the new lost in space as a killer mechanical beast , looking like something straight out of robocop . although the family is saved at the last minute by will , the new robot never achieves the charm of the old . and the movie gets as lost as the family . the picture's morose ending includes equal mixtures of childhood angst , dark ruminations on the effects of absent fathers , and an ugly monster lifted from aliens . it is rated pg-13 for profanity , science fiction violence , and a scary monster and would be fine for kids around nine and up . my son jeffrey , age 9 , gave it * * * * and said he absolutely loved the movie because of all of its space stuff . eliot called it \" junk , \" and nickolas and matthew complained that it didn't have a story or a plot .",

            "message": "so what would cause 2 grown women and about 2 dozen grown men to faint ? lest you faint , let me tell you up-front that the same jackie chan plays them both . jackie chan films are endurable and enjoyable only because of the boyish charm and energetic bravado of chan himself . the scripts for his movies are usually so thin that , without jackie chan , it would be almost ridiculous to contemplate going to see them . twin dragons , originally released in 1992 , has just been re-released theatrically without allowing the film to be screened in advance to film critics . this is probably smart marketing since , among the jackie chan films , this one is probably one of the silliest and lamest . if you have not seen his movies before , you might be inclined to shake your head and walk out during the first 10 minutes of this one , as it's quite ludicrous . leaving would be a mistake , although going in the first place is still questionable . once you're there , stick around because jackie , especially in the film's grand finale , gets to perform one amazing martial arts feat after another . the whole movie is little more than a ruse for jackie to show us his martial arts skills in a comedic setting . in this broad parody , boomer fights not 1 , not 2 , not 3 but 20 men at a time and eventually wins just before he seems certain to be beaten completely to a pulp . although his later films are much better , this one does have its moments . the plot , such as it is , concerns the misadventures of mr . ma in hong kong as he is mistaken for boomer , and vice versa . when one sneezes , so does the other . the movie is way over-the-top slapstick , but for jackie's die-hard fans , no movie of his can be too hokey . for most of us , we'd be better off renting one of his later , more polished movies and passing on this re-release . it is rated pg-13 for comedic violence , sexual situations and profanity and would be fine for kids 10 or 11 and up . my son jeffrey , age 10 , found the film confusing , and , although he liked the martial arts , he gave the movie only * 1/2 . his friend steven , age 10 , thought there was a little too much fighting , but liked the comedy enough to give the movie * * 1/2 . his twin , john , thought the movie was really good and worth * * * 1/2 . their friend alan , almost 10 , thought the movie was awesome and was a * * * * motion picture .",

            "message": "it is considered by many to be a classic movie and is the first part of director satyajit ray's \" apu trilogy . \" the movie has a lot going for it , not the least of which is extremely earnest and heartfelt performances by all of the cast . in its depiction of abject poverty it reminded me somewhat of king vidor's our daily bread ( 1934 ) and john ford's the grapes of wrath ( 1940 ) . i am sorry to report that , being one of the slowest films i have ever seen , i did not like pather panchali . sincerity is not enough for me ; i like a movie where something happens . at first i had trouble figuring out what was going on since not much of anything was happening so i figured i was missing something . after a while it dawned on me that pather panchali is a slice of life movie , but one at a glacial pace . the director gets lots of long sequences of people looking pensively . the movie works best in the scenes of everyday life . most of the movie consists of incidents like durga stealing fruit from the old family orchard that used to belong to them . pather panchali may be an acquired taste . certainly the acting is straight forward and earnest , but not much actually happens in the film and what does happen happens so slowly . i think tighter editing ( dulal dutta ) and a more energetic script ( bibhutibhushan bandyopadhyay and satyajit ray ) would have kept my attention better . finally , for me the best part of the picture is the music by ravi shankar who was then an unknown musician . it is sublime . pather panchali runs 1 : 55 , but i think it would have been much more effective at about 1 : 25 . the picture is filmed in black and white and the print i saw was in acceptable shape , but showed its age . the film is in bengali with english subtitles . it is not rated , but would certainly be rated g . there is exactly one mildly harsh word in it , and there is no sex , nudity , or violence . the movie would be fine for children of any age , but the slowness would lose most of the young ones . i admire the sincerity of the film , but i can not recommend it no matter how much of a classic it is . it is unmercifully slow . for its sweetness i give * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

            "message": "the neon bible is a innovative film by terence davies , who did the acclaimed distant voices , still lives . the neon bible has a highly confusing narrative but with much technical brilliance underneath . it is a hard picture to describe since it is a collage of images from a boy's past . the movie is shown in flashbacks . the acting is passable . rowlands is the best of the lot , but below average for her . scarwid is over the top and not believable . my biggest problem is with tierney who approaches the character of david with such detachment . rarely does he waste time showing any emotion and yet , this is david's life we are seeing so you would expect more animation . quite a boring performance . many scenes have little or no dialog . it is the sort of show that has you staring for a long time trying to figure out where the show is going and why . i did not know the show's length and actually thought it was ending after half an hour . after one hour into the show , the picture begins to make some sense , but never comes together . at the end , i found myself thinking what a mess , but yet there are many magical and special parts of this disappointing movie . let's not waste any more time on what is wrong with the neon bible . there are technical aspects so special that were they in a better film , they could have been spectacular . let me cite just three examples . second , the scene transitions frequently start high up , like in the stars , and then move down slowly into the scene like a memory might start in your subconscious and then slowly form . editor charles rees deserves some of the credit too for the magical transitions . in the press kit , davies discusses the look of the film . i especially liked the nehi drink signs on the stores . you could get one of those for a nickel and for fifteen cents more you could have a hamburger too . the dialog , when there is any , does have a few good lines . they used to say in school , 'you have to think for yourself , ' but you couldn't do that in town . you have to think what your father thought and that was what everybody thought . \" i will be happy if someday writers describing the south of that era will not feel obligated to include a ku klux klan scene as this one did . i grew up in the south just after this time , and i never saw a kkk rally in my entire life , and i don't know anybody that ever has . yes , they happened , but they were fairly rare . writers should not feel obliged to include them , especially as the scene here is superfluous to the story . the neon bible runs 1 : 31 . i do not believe film is rated . there is no sex , nudity , or bad language that i can remember . there is a mild amount of violence . except for a single brief violent scene , it would probably get a pg rating . as it stands , i think it is pg-13 material . the show will bore most kids , but any kid over say 8 or 9 should be able to watch it . i sat there with my mouth agape in most of the show so i certainly can not recommend it , but for its technical brilliance i do give it * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : june 29 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

            "message": "what have we come to as a culture that we can look with nostalgia at the events of a mere decade ago ? to most people nostalgia means events that happened several decades ago . even films about the 70s like the ice storm and boogie nights seem to be covering a time that happened too recently to parody with bad clothes and ridiculous sets . the wedding singer attempts a nostalgic look at the classic period of the mid-1980s , 1985 to be precise . although most people will have trouble remembering how 1985 was different from today , the wedding singer clears it up . in the previous decade we wore incredibly bad clothes with heavy reliance on clashing colors of lavender , pink , and lime green . our tastes in household decorations looked like an updated version of the ticky-tacky 50s . how soon we forget how awful we were . the wedding singer frustrates and delights with equal measures . one minute it is an over-the-top comedy that is gratingly bad , and the next it is a surprising sweet and touching little romance . director frank coraci exerts little control over his picture , which drifts aimlessly from bad to good and then back again . with long hair and a completely different look and approach , happy gilmore's star , adam sandler , plays robby . his uneven performance can be blamed partly on the script by tim herlihy , who also penned happy gilmore , but it is mostly sandler's own fault . the main reason , other than the energetic music , for the success of the movie is the lovely performance by the female lead , drew barrymore . julia is engaged and her romance , like robby's , is equally ill-fated . in the predictable , but none the less charming , romance developing between them , robby and julia don't realize that they are in love until almost the end . it isn't until julia practices her wedding ceremony kiss with robby -- she's not sure the degree of tongue that is appropriate in a church setting -- that they realize that they have the hots for each other . when robby isn't doing something stupid like the embarrassingly bad scene in which he ruins someone else's wedding party just because he is depressed , the chemistry between julia and robby is genuine and captivating . drew barrymore has innocence down pat . the supporting cast has lots of promise , partially realized . if -- and that's a big if -- you can ignore the stupefyingly bad comedy , you will find that the movie has a big heart underneath . rewritten this could be a wonderful movie . even as it is , it still has a lot to recommend it . it is rated pg-13 for sex-related material and language and would be fine for kids around ten and up .",

( \" you told me you had the answers , \" complains an angry mulder . \" i don't have them all , \" replies dr . kurtzweil . periodically , spooky creatures turn up to spice things up , and the movie becomes aliens-lite . among the many joys of the film is that we are able to deduce that hertz must have a rent-a-tractor outlet in antarctica . you can check one out without a reservation and go joy riding alone across the vast frozen landscape . and when you get tired of driving , you can try your hand at spelunking . at the end of the credits , we learn that the story was all fiction . or so they want us to believe . it is rated pg-13 for violence and gore and would be fine for kids 11 and up .",

( the problem with your kids' watching movie series is that it is not always easy to start them with the first episode . it was a simple matter of a bad headcount on the airport shuttle and , what with the commotion of leaving , etc . , they didn't notice kevin's absence . culkin displays a wide range of acting emotions . he is especially cute hamming it up in front of the mirror . looking brave , wise , and yet vulnerable , culkin is perfect for the role . imaginative , kevin turns on all the lights , cranks up the stereo , and moves cardboard cutouts on his electric train to make his house look chockfull of adults . using relentlessly upbeat christmas music by star wars's john williams , the movie contrasts the joyous holiday season with the less than ideal situation in which kevin and his parents find themselves . although the two robbers are central to the storyline , the movie is at its best when they are nowhere to be seen . they cause the sweet , original movie to dissolve into cheap slapstick that you've seen many times before . a little of stern and pesci goes a long way , and home alone has them in almost every scene in the last half of the movie . too bad kevin's adversaries had to be so terminally stupid - the rest of the picture isn't . it is rated pg for comic violence and would be fine for most kids . my son jeffrey , age 9 , gave the movie * * * .",

's style too eclectic for my taste . this is not surprising since his last film was that major bomb , even cowgirls get the blues . nevertheless , i do like to die for . they do a wonderful job of making suzanne into an extremely made up woman in very brief miniskirts and yet they never go over the line and overdo it . the pushed her look to the absolute limit , but never made her look sleazy . to die for runs 1 : 40 , and i think the editors ( jeffrey arsenault and curtiss clayton ) should have left a few more entire scenes on the cutting room floor so that the meantime to laugher was much smaller . the movie is rated r for sex , understated violence , some profanity , and about one second of nudity from a far distance . it is a soft r , and i would see no problem in teenagers seeing the show . there were certainly many in the audience where i was . i give to die for a thumbs up for kidman's performance , for interesting docudrama style cinematography , and for some huge laughs , and i award it * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : october 6 , 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

            "message": "a movie as a star vehicle is an honored tradition . so in 1967 when still fairly new director franco zeffirelli wanted to make his first big hollywood picture , he cast both richard burton and elizabeth taylor . the film was the taming of the shrew and with superstars like that how could he miss . the acting was sure to be good , and the press would cover every antic on the set thus building up the excitement for its release . the quality of the result is debatable , but one thing is certain , burton and taylor clearly have great fun with their acting assignments . the audience at the six weeks shakespeare festival at san jose's camera three seemed to be having a good time as well . in my judgment shakespearean comedies work best when the directors rely on the words for the humor . this is the path that kenneth branagh chose for much ado about nothing . zeffirelli opted instead for slapstick figuring that the play needed to be jazzed up with many sight gags and general physical comedy . moreover , although the words sound authentic , screenwriters suso cecchi d'amico , paul dehn , and franco zeffirelli seem to have modified a fair amount of the bard's text . i must admit that whenever i see the writing of a movie is done by a committee i take that as a bad omen . the picture is filmed by oswald morris ( academy award winner for fiddler on the roof ) and luciano trasatti in a hazy glow as if through a slightly rose tinted lens . to complement this rosy glow , the academy award nominated sets by john decuir , giuseppe mariani , lorenzo mongiardino , and elven webb look like a disney prototype for a renaissanceland . since zeffirelli viewed the play as a romp , these images help establish the spirit of the film . the story is typical for shakespeare -- full of false identities where people are not who they seem to be . taylor spends most of the first part of the film grunting and throwing things . although by the end the slapstick does subside , we have to endure flying tables of dust and other acts i found lacking in much real humor . zeffirelli also had many filthy servants with bad teeth in his attempt to provide increased mirth . sadly that was not as often as it should have been . taylor is a famous yo-yo dieter , but she was just the right size when the movie was filmed -- certainly not svelte but trim and with an overflowing bosom shown to advantage in the clothes of the period . burton too looks the part of a crude but cunning man . petruchio complains that it is , \" nothing but sit and sit , and eat and eat ! \" for the record , my all time favorite shakespeare movie is zeffirelli's romeo and juliet where he plays it straight . not a bad movie , but there is more potential lost than realized . i enjoyed it enough , but i would not want to see it again . the show appears not to be rated , but it would be a pg for some of the bawdy references . there is no sex , nudity , violence , or modern profanity . the show would be fine for kids of any age , but they would probably have to be at least nine to be interested in it . i give the show thumbs up and award it * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

( the film inappropriately has been tagged with an nc-17 rating , which director gregor nicholas protested and lost . the press kit explains the mpaa appeals board said that one of the film's love making scenes contains \" buttock thrusting , \" so they felt that they had to rate it nc-17 . given the massive violence in countless r-rated shows , and the more explicit sex and more rampant nudity in many other r-rated films , it seems strange that one motion would make such a difference , but apparently it did . it would seem the mpaa believes it is the latter since the former gets a film the more profitable r-rating and latter condemns the movie to an nc-17 . some newspapers will not even carry advertisements for nc-17 films . ) the third story , which remains no more than an outline , is about eddie's family , his people and his culture . we see them from afar in a few scenes , but we rarely venture into their world . only his beloved whakapapa tree provides a link to this undeveloped part of the story . both of these chinese characters are so badly stereotyped that it becomes embarrassing to watch . the film smolders as if building to an explosive conclusion . when the ending comes , it is remarkably plain and unoriginal and packs little wallop . a bit scary , certainly , but nothing out of the ordinary . with a surfeit of stories , the audience is too often shortchanged . an overly ambitious film , it does manage to deliver on the romance even if it too often buries it in the manipulative saga of the brutal family . it is inappropriately rated nc-17 . although there is sex , nudity , violence , profanity , and dope smoking , the level is on a par with most r-rated films and the violence is less . the movie would be fine for mature teenagers . i liked the picture just enough to be able to recommend it and give it * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : may 2 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

( most engineering schools probably don't disclose this . ) in the spirit of the original speed , his plan to take control of the ship is ingenious and full of technical details . dafoe takes a surprisingly understated approach to his character . i respect him for what he was trying to do , but it drained the show of too much of its tension . andrew davis's under siege covered a similar subject with much better results because tommy lee jones gave us a more explosive and unpredictable villain . the movie's best performance is given by first-time movie actress christine firkins as a 13-year-old deaf girl named drew . i cannot say enough good things about firkins's acting ability . a charismatic actress who takes what could have been a cliched character and transforms her into a frightened but resourceful girl and a character worth caring about . like most recent action picture endings , this one goes on too long . unlike the others , speed 2 manages to throw so much at us that it stays fun much longer than expected . the little pooch's fun becomes so infectious that i found myself applauding at one piece of the conclusion's campy humor . speed 2 runs longer than necessary at 2 : 13 . it is rated pg-13 for disaster action and violence . the film would be fine for kids say nine and up , depending on how well they handle disaster movies . i had enough fun to be able to recommend the picture and give it * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : june 11 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

( so the big question is when does hitchcock make his obligatory walk-on ? don't miss it . ) watch how the camera angles are sometimes from the back and other times from way on high to set the exact tone for the trial's action . the end includes many devastating revelations and some nice twists so it is too bad the first half is so languid . the picture is in black and white . it is not rated but would be pg for mature themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up if they are interested .",

( it also has the misfortune of being released in a time when we have the lowest unemployment rate in several decades , so the tragedy of downsizing is no longer on many newspaper headlines or many people's minds . ) although the jubilant moore tries his best to make him look foolish , knight finds the whole episode hilarious , laughing through almost every minute of it . so where does the title of the movie come from ? in the funniest segment of all , moore discusses how we could better market \" the united states of america . \" he proposes we rename our country , \" the big one , \" since that's how we see our place in the world anyway . he goes on to propose the music , \" we will , we will - rock you , \" as a more powerful national anthem , cutting to a pumped-up crowd singing it while lasers pulsate around them . it is rated pg-13 for some strong language and would be fine for kids around twelve and up .",

( the title is guaranteed to strike the same terror in the hearts of video store owners when the movie makes its way to video that abbie hoffman's book , \" steal this book ! \" the unabashedly one-sided movie by director robert greenwald , a friend of abbie and anita hoffman , is a lucid and intriguing tale of perhaps the most famous of the vietnam war protestors . freed from any pretense of objectivity , the fast-paced movie creates a flattering story as the late abbie hoffman might himself have told . \" dull is deadly \" , abbie explains as the rationale for his outlandish theatrics . vincent d'onofrio turns in an energetic and endearing performance as the charismatic , smart abbie hoffman , a self-described \" long-haired , revolutionary freak . \" the strong supporting cast includes donal logue , who appears in every other movie this summer and in various sizes from his pillsbury dough boy in the tao of steve to his more modest size this time as stew albert , abbie's best friend . kevin pollak does a nice turn as gerry lefcourt , abbie's savvy and tolerant lawyer . bruce graham's bright script , based on books by abbie and anita hoffman and by marty jezer , is funny and insightful . \" if you don't like abbie's mood , wait a minute , \" anita tells johanna about abbie , who was eventually diagnosed as a manic-depressive . ever the philosopher , abbie's mouth is a shotgun of ideas . the movie does a marvelous job of authentically capturing the look and mood of the period . the movie dichotomizes the people in abbie's life into either friends or enemies , with the former being the world's good guys and the latter being the bad . the police , especially the fbi , are uniformly depicted as little better than the gestapo . too often , films with strong political agendas present us with false alternatives rather than admitting that they are really only telling one side of the argument . steal this movie ! works precisely because it stays strictly true to its opinions . you may not subscribe to them , but you'll understand them much better after seeing the picture . and you'll gain fascinating insights into the life of someone you may have never even cared about before . but , most of all , you'll have a high old time while reliving one of our nation's more turbulent eras . steal this movie ! it is rated r for language , drug content and some nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers .",

            "message": "do you like reading short stories ? are you willing to stay with a picture where not much happens but where you get to eavesdrop on a host of endearing characters ? well , if you do , i have just the film for you , rendezvous in paris ( les rendez-vous de paris ) . films today either sex or don't . there is little time for romance . actually , that is over with quickly too so they can cut to the action scenes and the violence which is understood to be what it takes to sell tickets these days . remember nothing sells popcorn like a film full of fistfights and car chases . there is a subtler form of romance known as flirting and few films waste time with that . rendezvous in paris has such non-stop flirting that it could have been called flirting except that title was taken . when you leave you may yourself winking at the person at the snack bar unless you are careful . this film puts you in love with love . the format for the film is that there are three short stories . introducing each are some hokey street singers and images that look like they are lifted straight out of a 50s film . the picture itself was consciously filmed with a hazy look by cinematographer diane baratier . the director wanted this nostalgic look , but it may send you to the concession stand to complain until you know it is on purpose . this story ends in the biggest twist , but all three stories have somewhat of a surprising ending . we were in paris this summer , and i found the second story reminded me of our trip . we saw more intense necking on the streets in a week than i've seen in several years in cities in america . rendezvous in paris is a wonderful talkfest of a film . if there is any recent movie that even remotely resembles it , it would probably be that wonderful film before sunrise from last year . some may criticize rendezvous in paris as being inconsequential , but for me it is a real treat that grows on you as you see it and is one of those few films whose images are indelibly marked in your memory . finally , the actors are mainly a bunch of unknowns , but all deliver strong performances . their screen presence is incredible , and the camera is love with them . it is in french ( appropriately called the language of love ) , but with sharp and easy to read english subtitles . it is rated pg , and there is nothing to offend anyone of any age . there is no sex , nudity , violence , or bad language . except that three year olds will have little interest in romance , the film could easily have been rated g . i recommend the show to anyone of any age interested in love and flirting , and i award it * * * . now , don't forget to be careful when you pass the person at the snack bar if your spouse is with you . in the real world , flirting can get you in a lot of trouble . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

            "message": "so what is beneath your feet ? when told to be more observant , most people cast their eyes skyward to see what might be above them that they are missing . and none of us have sensitive enough ears to heard the cacophony as the insects scurry about . viewers , other than certified entomologists , will find the world of the insects a totally unknown and magical one full of sound and fury . the film can even be seen as a romantic comedy , but this was the part my son liked least of all . for the comedic part , there are two beetles that begin a romantic entanglement of such intensity that they almost shake themselves off the tiny branch on which they are perched . like two lovers parked in a volkswagen , their choice of locale is just too confining . the brilliance of the documentary is not in the directing ( claude nuridsany and marie perennou ) nor the editing ( florence ricard and marie-josephe yoyotte ) although both are well done . what makes the film come alive is the technical mastery of the cinematography by thierry machado , claude nuridsany , marie perennou , and hugues ryffel . most sequences start with your typical view of a field and then , as in honey i shrunk the kids , the cameras move down to ground level . they use special lens to bring insects to life in incredible detail and with colors so bright they would put disney to shame . if you are not in awe of nature before you enter the theater , you will be when you exit . the photographers use some slow motion effects as when flowers are open . most of the scenes however are at normal speed . there are many great scenes in the picture . easily the most fascinating scene is that of the sacred beetle rolling its sheep dung pellet . how does a sacred beetle push a sheep dung pellet you ask ? when it gets stuck on a small twig , the poor beetle's brain is too small to figure out the simple solution -- just go to the other side and push it off . instead , our little guy uses sheer perseverance and hard work to dislodge it . imagine you are out on a lake and drops the size of cars start pounding you . pretty frightening . this is one of many times in microcosmos where the sound is even more impressive than the images . there are some problems with the film that would have been easy to fix . the show bogs down toward the end . the last quarter operates at a slower pace , and little of interest is shown . my son fell asleep during this part , and i don't blame him . she says a few words at the start and at the end , but nothing more . more narration , as the wonderful disney nature films from the 1950s showed , can add interest , humor , and enlightenment . i kept wondering what insect was i seeing and what was he doing . finally , the music by bruno coulais is quite effective but is used all too sparsely . microcosmos is a technical tour de force . i can't image missing something this unique . besides , where else can you see a show suitable for kids without a single product tie-in ? microcosmos runs just 1 : 20 , but would have been better with the last 15 minutes excised . the film has no humans and hence no human sex , nudity , or violence . yes , the insects do have sex , but your little ones will never figure out what is going on unless you care to tell them . my son jeffrey , age 7 1/2 , gives the show a \" thumbs up but so slightly down that you couldn't tell . \" i recommend the film to you and your whole family and give it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

            "message": "few directors have such a unique , some would say bizarre , style as david lynch . his latest , lost highway , is his most unorthodox film yet , but one of his better ones . the press kit describes the movie as a \" psychogenic fugue \" and a \" moebius strip \" with elements of lewis carroll and franz kafka . yes , it is all of those and more . lost highway blends film noir with the tension of a horror movie . the power comes from the director's use of silence . ( as you read this review you may be inclined to conclude that you have no interest in seeing the movie , but the film works more effectively than any possible verbal description of it might lead you to believe . ) the sound effects editing and the music enhance the heavy tension . at first , the film has complete silence interspersed with dialog -- no background ambient noise at all . slowly , low natural background sounds are introduced and then this gives way to music consisting of long , low rumbling notes designed to frighten . i see so many films that i get somewhat desensitized , but the first part of this movie managed to scare me badly with devices as natural as the sudden , loud ringing of a phone . an intense and very disturbing film in the beginning . when the parameters of the mystery are revealed , the tension stays , but the film becomes much less disquieting . i am not going to cover any of the film's details . i will just set up the first few minutes of the film . suffice it to say that the film involves character transformation , reincarnation , surreal dreams , and more . to give a feel of what is in store for the viewers , consider another early scene . the script by barry gifford and david lynch perplexes the viewers with all of the false views and disconcerting realities of an escher print . some of the vignettes in the film are priceless . the cinematography by peter deming pushes the limits of the film noir motif . not only are scenes dark but some characters walk into the darkness and disappear as if into an astronomical black hole . you can think of the show as a film constructed with non-euclidean geometry . i still don't understand it , but the movie is not made to be comprehensible . what is less satisfying is the way characters caught in a deadly web such as this never seek advice on what is happening to them . the answers to this and all of the film's conundrums are in the final analysis , unknowable . it is rated r for graphic violence , sex , nudity , and profanity . teenagers should be mature if they go . i was fascinated by this long enigma so i recommend it to you and give it * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

( personally , i would not be scared if i knew that creatures looking like members of the star wars cantina , but more gooey , were infesting our planet . but you might panic . ) rich baker's work designing the aliens certainly deserves oscar consideration for his mixture of silliness and function -- sort of a retro science fiction look for the 90s . mary e . vogt's costumes for the agents , think 60s james bond suave with tapered suits , thin ties , and plain ray ban sunglasses -- all in black , provide the perfect complement to the aliens' kookiness . ed solomon's script has a stream of gags , most of which work , thanks to barry sonnenfeld's direction . j is shown a wall of television screens which are used to monitor such aliens as sylvester stallone , steven spielberg , newt gingrich , and others . perhaps the most instructive is that we learn that division 6 uses the hot sheets , you know them as the tabloids , as research material . the sincerity with which the actors approach their material makes the movie . while posing as an fbi agent , k explains in no uncertain terms that , \" we here at the fbi , do not have a sense of humor we are aware of . \" men in black is one of the few films that would be better if it were longer . editor jim miller has simply chopped too much . the resulting movie feels like they were scared that we would grow tired if shown too much of it , so they trimmed out every non-essential scene . the result is a story that jerks along as if key scenes are missing . oh yes , along the way there is the outline of a plot . still , you are likely to have trouble following the plot even if you take good notes . much better to sit back and enjoy such morsels as edgar's . \" you're coming with me , \" he informs her . \" it's a long trip . i'll need a snack . \" it is rated pg-13 for some mild profanities and sci-fi violence . the film should be fine for most kids around 8 and up . my son jeffrey , age 8 , got pretty scared and even talked about leaving at times , but ended up liking the show . i thought the show was funny and imaginative so i am recommending it and giving it * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

( this is one of those good shows -- sling blade was another -- which will immediately be written off by many people as soon as the plot is described . afterall , not many moviegoers go to the entertainment section looking for a good cockroach film . ) the shadowy mood combined with the script's proper sense of timing -- the best monster movies delay our first complete view of the monster as long as possible -- yields a film that builds its terror properly . just as some of the sexiest films are those in which the people stay fully dressed but seem always on the verge of taking off their clothes , so it is with monster movies , the tease is the key . in the entire first hour of mimic , the monster , in the form of a shadowy figure of a man in a cloak , is seen only in glimpses . marco beltrami's eerie and foreboding music adds to the ever-present feeling that death is right around the corner . almost all of the story happens three years later , and -- you guessed it -- the judas breed did not die out , but instead mutated into something dastardly and human-sized . of course , at first we don't know that for sure . as in all horror films , people do stupid things . in fact the light of flickering bad florescent lights and low-wattage incandescent bulbs adds dramatically to the horrific ambiance . figures in the background are seen , but escape just before being noticed as the audience whispers a collective \" look out ! \" \" can i eat it or will it eat me ? \" it turns out is what those little critters are always thinking . and do our big bugs ever eat : children , pets , big beefy men , you name it . the fright , however , does not come from visual gore since most meals are savored off-screen . there is even a boy with a heightened sense of hearing who calls the big bug , \" mr . funny shoes \" for the sounds he makes . while the picture is certainly frightening , it is even more fascinating . mimic has just enough scientific underpinnings to make the story interesting and not seem too ridiculous . the ending , although predictable in its outcome , has several surprises that use almost plausible scientific theories . mimic is an aliens set in our time and with a terrific look that begs to be seen even though the potential for fright is ever-present . one thing is certain . after seeing it , you will look at street grates in a totally different way . it is rated r for terror and a little profanity . the show would be fine for teenagers who can handle horror flicks . i recommend the picture to you and give it * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

            "message": "\" i'd rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell , \" earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher . with that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister , hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story . instead it gives us a highly devout man , who certainly has his foibles , but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god . and arguably just as surprising , the good-spirited film is no comedy , even if it does have humorous moments . instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures . robert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the film's director , writer , executive producer , and chief financier . rarely has a movie been such a labor of love . with a white suit , peach-colored shirt and tie , and dark sunglasses , sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher . duvall has every movement down pat . \" i may be on the devil's hit-list , but i'm on god's mailing list , \" he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent . and they lap it up . people jump up , scream , \" praise the lord ! \" and mean it . the intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable . but sonny is no saint . his romance with the separated woman , like the rest of the film , doesn't follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies . his confrontation with the apostle is yet another of show's many surprising scenes , again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take . although it probably couldn't have ended any other way , the movie does wrap things up nicely . and don't miss the sweet epilogue during the film's closing credits . a tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film . it is rated pg-13 for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up .",

( the brief orgy scene is the one in which american audiences are \" spared \" the embarrassment of seeing intercourse . we have digital fig leaves in the form of extra bodies inserted in front of some of the obviously copulating couples . these few seconds of changes keep the movie from getting an nc-17 . the rest of the world gets the director's cut . if the characters had committed murder instead of sex , no cover-up would have been required . ) as has been widely reported , kidman's performance is stellar and will undoubtedly get her at least a nomination for an oscar . her acting stays right on the edge . cruise's acting is no less impressive . larry smith's oversaturated , grainy cinematography depicts well the grime that has entered the characters' heretofore-spotless life . jocelyn pook's loud , staccato piano score for the film reminds us of bill's fear and panic , as if we can hear his heart beating out of his chest . the rich picture leaves us with so much left to discuss , the film's many religious allusions being just one topic out of many . \" it always does . until it doesn't . but you know that , don't you ? \" what will happen next is undoubtedly much more complex than the last scene implies . in this movie , to which there will most certainly not be a sequel , it is left to audiences to decide the fate of the tragic couple . in a film that revels in its ambiguity , the ending is the most intriguingly ambiguous of all . the best filmmakers provide the best questions , not the easiest answers . it is in the not-quite-resolved conclusion that this film serves as a fitting tribute to kubrick's legacy . it is rated r for strong sexual content , nudity , language and some drug-related material and would be fine for teenagers only if they are older and mature .",

            "message": "how about this for a concept ? an autobiographical story about a boy and his dog that doesn't have any special effects , no talking animals and no promotional toy tie-ins . jay russell's my dog skip is just a good , old-fashioned , heart-warming story that is so genuine and touching that it should appeal to people of all ages , even those with no kids . the sweetest little dog imaginable , skip is a lovable pup who's full of energy . the director finds lots of adorable things for the canine to do without ever letting the story turn schmaltzy . typical of the inspired staging is the delightful , time-lapse visual of skip as he is growing up until he is finally big enough to jump up and drink from the family's white porcelain toilet bowl . \" the dog of your boyhood teaches you a great deal , \" willie tells us of skip . \" you could talk to him better than you could talk to most human beings . \" the movie is filled with wonderfully poetic narration by harry connick , jr . , as the voice of the adult willie . and this was the summer that willie learned quite a few . many of the episodes are quite humorous , and all are honest and genuine . the warmly nostalgic picture is filmed in radiantly inviting colors and filled with richly evocative music . as a viewer , you will vicariously get to enjoy skip's friendship . and if you find yourself both applauding and crying during the picture , as i did , don't be surprised . actually , if you don't cry , you'll probably want to get a check-up . the film joyously reminds us all of just how wonderful life can be . the good-spirited picture will likely bring back many fond memories of your childhood . i too had a terrier , although mine was half cocker spaniel . there are other similarities , but i can't mention them without giving away key plot points . i relived my childhood while watching the film . what more could you ask for ? my dog skip runs 1 : 35 . it is rated pg for some violent content and mild language . the film would be fine for all ages , including people without kids at all . be warned , however , that some of the tragedies in the picture may briefly frighten impressionable kids under around 8 . my son jeffrey , age 10 , absolutely adored the movie . he gave it * * * * and said that it should win an oscar . he liked everything about the movie , and he loved skip . jeffrey's buddy nickolas , age 10 , gave the picture * * * , saying it was funny and had a good plot . and , of course , he too thought skip was terrific .",

' a computerized teddy bear ( voiced by jack angel ) , who asserts `i am not a toy , ' is the film's most endearing character , calling to mind spielberg's famous and loveable e . t . david is the film's most tragic character . the intricate script recalls parts of many movies , including sid's toy chest from toy story and the bar scene from the original star wars . stan winston's robotic special effects are amazing , as always . mechas are chopped up , blown up , melted and otherwise slaughtered to delight a cheering crowd . he's a love doll , who does not really love , but can only `make love . ' robin williams -- who else ? -- does a nice turn as the humorous dr . know , a franchised , electronic knowledge dispenser , to whom david turns for advice . john williams's music with its creepy undercurrents reminds us to always be on our guard . filmed in a beautiful haze by janusz kaminski ( shindler's list ) , the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat as you are sweep into its mysteries and its characters . after reaching an absolutely perfect concluding spot , the last act tacks on a long feel good ending that is more likely to infuriate than to please . the result is less than a masterpiece but much , much more than the typical movie fare . and it is , thankfully , a summer movie with something on its mind . a . i . artificial intelligence runs 2 : 20 . it is rated pg-13 for some sexual content and violent images and would be acceptable for kids around 12 and up . my son jeffrey , age 12 , gave it * * 1/2 . he thought it was interesting and had impressive images . he was troubled by what he thought were many logical holes . he also complained that it ended at the wrong place , saying , `not all fairy tales have to end perfectly in happy endings .

            "message": "there is a movement afoot in the movie business to restore some of the great classic films so that this generation can see them afresh . some of the work like that done on the umbrellas of cherbourg allows the movie to be better even than that seen by even the original movie audience . so it is with the restoration of alfred hitchcock's 1958 masterpiece vertigo . working with some of the original master tapes , the restorers have given the film a digital stereo sound track . hearing bernard herrmann's music conducted by that great master muir mathieson makes the effort worthwhile . his haunting melodies are quite dramatic with the horns using their lowest notes . that the restorers also give us a cleaned up print and vastly improved color rendition is a bonus . restoration is a difficult process depending on many factors . here the result is less than perfect , which is not meant as a criticism . the interior sequences are bursting with rich and highly textured colors , but the exterior ones still seem a bit washed out . there are a couple of scenes where the print gets too dark and where the color matching is off . on the whole , however , the restoration works , and it is a joy to see this classic in its full glory . this feeling of acrophobia or vertigo is nothing more than a plot device . it provides the glue that holds the mystery of the story together . what makes the film so compelling are the characters swept up in the vertigo of the mystery . bel geddes is easily the most likable actor in the story . midge's costumes by the great edith head and the make-up by wally westmore give her the image of a good looking nerd . she has attractive but overly conspicuous glasses , and clothes that are all too sensible . if you love san francisco as much as i do , and especially if you live near it as i do , the movie provides more gorgeous san francisco settings for you to savor than any other movie . period . it was an awful film , but as i sat watching the expensive and slow minutia of a film shoot , i keep reflecting back to hitchcock's work there over three decades earlier and in the same spot outside . the camera work by robert burks is a masterful blend of wide-angle zooms to create the vertigo effect in the audience and of a traditional and panoramic approach . the automobile's role in movies has changed dramatically . alfred hitchcock is the king of the mysteries , which is not to say that his are without logical flaws . now that you ask , yes , hitchcock does his standard quick walk through one of the scenes . this \" where's waldo \" is a favorite of hitchcock fans like myself , and i certainly will give you no hints when this occurs . novak gives a wooden performance in the first half , but is quite intriguing in the second when she comes back to life as judy barton . stewart has not given a bad performance in his life . his acting as an obsessed man in vertigo is good , but not his best . just a couple of examples . ultimately what makes vertigo work so well is the direction by the great master and the stunning music and visuals . my main criticism of the film is that the editing by george tomasini is too slow . the film would have been more effective if more tightly focused and about fifteen more minutes had been left on the cutting room floor . the ending of the show is perfect and shocking if you have never seen it before . vertigo remains a classic bit of cinema that is worth seeing again . i would love to see some local theater do an alfred hitchcock festival . hint . hint . vertigo runs 2 : 08 . it is not rated but would be pg today due solely to the falling scenes . there is no sex , nudity , or bad language . the film will probably only interest kids say ten and up , but would be acceptable kids a little younger . i strongly recommend you check out the restoration now on the big screen as it was meant to be seen and heard . i give the film * * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

            "message": "the sound of music ( 1965 ) was one of the most popular films of the 1960s . although a bit corny , it is a joyous musical odyssey suitable for the entire family . today , too often what goes for musicals , see for example evita , is little more that a show with a single decent song . in the sound of music every song is tuneful and most are memorable and moving . some shows are meant to be seen in a movie theater on a large screen with an impressive sound system to match . the sound of music is one of them . nevertheless , our family enjoyed it at home . we have a high quality home theater setup , but the full effect can only be experienced in a real theater . i have not seen the film that way in thirty years . this review is from the home viewing rather than my memory . the academy award for best picture for 1965 went to the sound of music as did that for director robert wise . ( you can read my recent review of his quite different film from 1951 , the day the earth stood still . ) the film also garnered the award for music and editing plus many nominations . only the supporting actress nomination to peggy wood as mother abbess did not make sense to me . wood had a somewhat insignificant role and did not impress me with her acting in it . nicely done , but nothing outstanding . although i never saw mary martin as maria , it is hard for me to believe she could have had the infectious joy and energy that andrews brought to the role . this is hard to describe other than to say it is a blend of a travelogue , a nature documentary , a musical , and a cinematographic tour de force wrapped into one . all i can say is that it would have been a hard choice to choose between them . he films it in a hazy pale blue with a white that sparkles . when the two teenagers in the room make eyes at each other in the romantic environment , you will feel like an adolescent all over again . it is a truly magical scene . the movie is filled with songs , and there are even some simple dance numbers . i can remember a time when i was a teenager like him and one kiss from a girl , especially a beautiful one , could evoke a response as strong as rolfe's . times change and teenagers are regretfully much more sexually sophisticated now . still , the lone kiss in that scene remains powerful . in a show that is so upbeat it has been criticized as being sappy , there is the tension of the looming war . \" just make sure it doesn't happen to you . \" although this war reality is ever-present and although the film is based on a true story , the movie feels like a lovely and enduring fairy tale . this is a movie filled with exuberance , memorable songs , and great beauty . the sound of music runs 2 : 55 . a bit long for a musical , but it is a lot of fun . the movie is not rated but would be a g . there is no sex , nudity , violence , or profanity . my son jeffrey , age 7 1/2 , gave it a thumb almost totally up . his only complaint was that he thought the ending should have told us more about what happens to them later . i agree and recommend it strongly to your family . i give it * * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : january 2 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

            "message": "toy story is an absolutely wonderful movie for both kids and adults . it stretches your mind creatively to look at inanimate objects with a new respect , and it dazzles your senses with a wonderful new art form , the full length computer generated movie that is a cross between a disney cartoon and a live action film . moreover , in a year with some quite imaginative kids movies ( the indian in the cupboard and the secret of roan inish being the second and third best of 1995 ) , this one stands head and shoulders above all of the rest . toy story is special because of the story itself and because of the computer generated animation that is nothing less than phenomenal . yes , this has been done before perhaps , but not to this scale and degree of sophistication . i look forward to many more magical pictures from this creative team . woody holds this elevated position by virtue of being andy's favorite toy . the tension surrounds what toys andy will get . the walk of the toy soldiers is great . remember that cheap toy soldiers have their feet stuck on a single strip of plastic which makes sneaking up on the enemy extremely difficult . this could mean their demise too , and as hamm , the piggy bank , puts it , \" yes sir , we're next month's garage sale fodder for sure . \" woody laments , \" what chance does a toy like me have against a buzz lightyear action figure ? \" the majority of the movie is about the conflicts between woody and buzz . there are excellent lessons taught to kids along the way . the story is full of demonstrations of good moral values as well as the illustration of what leading an evil life like that of the neighborhood bad kid , sid , can get you . i will not give any of this away . the ending is perfect too . see it all yourself . the toys are hyper-realistic , but the people in the movie are drawn more cartoon characterish . my wife , sally , said that she thought this was to make the point that it is the toys in the story that are real more than the people . i suspect she is right . the colors of the toys have a luminescence that i have not seen before on the screen . the accuracy of the toys is reminiscent of the vermeer and the other great dutch painters of the seventeenth century , absolute devotion to the small details and to lighting effects . the wonderful script ( joel cohen , john lasseter , alex sokolow , andrew stanton , and joss whedon ) uses dialog to make the toys come alive and yet be extremely funny . rex , the dinosaur , introduces himself to buzz saying , \" i'm from mattel . well , actually i'm from a smaller company that was purchased by mattel in a leveraged buyout . \" i hope the writers win a lot of awards . toy story runs a fast and extremely well paced 1 : 17 . i posit no one will get bored during this movie . it is rated g but i should warn people that young viewers may get scared by sid and his toys . luckily our two families had more laps than kids so that when the scary scenes came , all kids had a place to go . perhaps you should check your kid to lap ratio before you go . jeffrey gets angry at shows that scare him , but not this one . he took it in stride as part of the movie going experience . his version of revisionist history , by the way , claims that he actually gave the movie six thumbs up rather than just two . i give the movie my strongest recommendation and award it a full * * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

            "message": "in honor of my wife and my twenty-seventh wedding anniversary this past september the thirteenth , i am going to do something i've never done before . i am going to review a film i have not seen in ten years . since the true mark of a great movie is its ability to forever cast an indelible mark on our memory , reviewing a picture you haven't seen in a decade actually makes some sense . to this day , it is the only film i have seen more than four or five times . like trekies , we want to see the film constantly doing our courtship and could quote most of the lines . although i have long since lost count , i know the number of times we have seen the picture is between fifteen and twenty . we frequently would stay to see it twice in a row at the local mutliplex . a more romantic and realistic rendition of the nature of love , i have never seen . although the play \" romeo and juliet \" has been made into movies many times before and would be made again , no one has ever captured young love as zeffirelli did . first , the casting of two photogenic , talented , but unknown actors of the right age was the foundation upon which he created a masterpiece . with olivia hussey as juliet and leonard whiting as romeo he had the basic ingredients , but just having the right cast does not a masterpiece make . it only makes it possible . the only major actor was laurence olivier who was the narrator . all of the supporting cast were excellent , but pat heywood , john mcenery , milo o'shea , michael york were especially brilliant . mcenery's mercutio was a complex and bizarre reading that fit the spirit of the character perfectly . york's tybalt was excellent as a character not seeking a fight , but more than confident of his ability if forced by circumstances . it is interesting to note that only a few of these actors , including the stars , had much success after this film . when he presses juliet's hand at the dance , it is more erotic than many a scene today where the actors are all buck naked . finally , the balcony scene , which every student knows and probably thinks is trite , is made fresh in zeffirelli's capable hands . i liked the way zeffirelli handled this . he included it to show the reality of the situation , but editor reginald mills trimmed it down to just flash the scene on the screen before moving on . although it is clear from the beginning that this is a love affair that is destined for tragedy , when the tragedy does strike , the audience is crushed anyway . by the middle of the picture , it is impossible not to be in love with the two protagonists and thereby not want any harm to come to them . the ending is sad , but effective . this is the richest and most moving of any shakespeare play i have ever seen made for the screen , and as a critic , i have seen a lot of them . i can not leave this tribute to one of my absolute favorite pictures without mentioning a few of the outstanding technical aspects of the film . the lush and hazy cinematography by pasqualino de santis deservedly won the academy award that year . from the very first image , the audience is alerted that something special is about to unfold . the script by franco brusati , maestro d'amico , and franco zeffirelli is true to the play . brief sections of the play were removed to get the play down to the right length and pacing for a movie , but shakespeare's poetic language was not tampered with . the editing was flawless . the action sequences are full of energy , but never too choppy . the love scenes stay with the character perfectly . the academy award winning costumes by danilo donati are gorgeous . especially well done are the clothes worn at the dance and all of juliet's clothes . they are naturally lovely without being showy . finally , the music by nino rota is so memorable it leaves you with music and songs forever in your subconscious . i love the theme song and still hear it being played today . although i am sure i'll see it , it will probably feel like a sacrilege to this fan of zeffirelli's version . as always as a critic , i'll try to keep an open mind . it is not rated , but would probably get a pg today for the extremely brief nude scene and for the tragic theme . there is no sex or bad language . the picture would be fine for any kid old enough to be interested which is probably eight and up . i give this picture my strongest recommendation and my highest rating of * * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

            "message": "for reasons that partially escape me , this film had the same effect on me as the shawshank redemption . both were filled with marvelous performances and both had people in dire circumstances coping in ways that earned the empathy of their audience . the cliff's notes version of the film would be \" revenge , \" but if that makes you think of some cheap charles bronson action flick , then think again . the revenge here comes much later and in much more subtle and surprising ways . although certain portions are shocking , this is not one of those exploitive shows nor even one of the sensational , even if excellent shows like pulp fiction . for the record , let me say that i approached the film as fiction . it is reported to be based on fact , but whether it is or not is in some dispute . this is a great film regardless of its veracity . in fact , the single best part of the film is the highly literate script by levinson based on lorenzo carcaterra's novel . there is just enough humor in it to break the tension , but the script is filled with moving prose . told with heavy narration by lorenzo , a . a . i am going to resist the urge to tell you any more of the plot . you need to see the movie . few films have so many actors displaying their talent so effectively . i left the theater nothing short of amazed at what i had just seen . exquisitely crafted cinema . he also tells us that after seven years your record is purged so that you were never there and whatever happened , didn't . sleepers runs 2 : 32 , but feels like half that long since your eyes stay glued to the screen . sleepers is rated r for strong language , brief nudity , violence , and believable but not carefully done scenes of the rape of boys . teenagers , if they go , should be older and mature . i give this film my strongest recommendation and rate it a full * * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : october 15 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

            "message": "sometimes you are fortunate to see something so special and unusual that you have trouble writing about it . kenneth branagh's new hamlet affected me that way . every time i picked up my notes to finish writing about it , i would switch to some other review instead . ( during the christmas season , there are so many films opening that i stay behind . sometimes i even have three press screenings at once . you can see why the new york times needs three film critics to cover all the movies . ) so why is there all this buzz about yet another adaptation of william shakespeare's \" hamlet \" ? afterall , there have been twenty-eight hamlet movies already . surely there is no longer anything new to say . four hours plus a twenty minute intermission to be precise . granted , that for those who hate shakespeare , the idea of sticking around this long will sound like masochism . yet , even people not enamored with the bard may be as blown away by this film as was i . let me explain . branagh chose the film's length for two reasons . first , he wanted to break with tradition and do a full text version of the play . this means that viewers would get to enjoy the many minor scenes that directors eliminate because of time considerations . second , he wanted to allow enough time for the play to breathe . this is the groundbreaking idea that makes the play so uniquely accessible . hamlet has more lines worth pondering than ten other plays , but usually the listener can not pause to reflect on them because the actors are flying through their lines so they can get the movie completed within a traditional length . never i have i understood or appreciated hamlet so completely , and i predict that others fortunate enough to see the movie in its full four hour length will feel the same way . there is much history behind the running time . let me summarize what i heard about it . branagh wanted a four hour version , but the distributors and the theater owners thought it would be a financial disaster for them . normally they could fill the theater twice during that period . moreover , the shorter version will be a 35mm print , whereas the longer will be the original 70mm . we were supposed to see the 70mm four hour version , but the print was \" stuck in london , \" so we saw a 35mm print of the four hour version instead . like sergio leone's once upon a time in america ( 1984 ) , which has both a truncated and a full length version , the longer one is the one is see . i would drive hours to see the four hour version of hamlet . given there was a massive storm the day i saw it , that is exactly what i did and was it ever worth it . this adaptation of the play is set in the nineteenth century . the exterior scenes were shot at blenheim palace where they used more artificial snow than any movie in history . yes , even more than doctor zhivago . ( the press kit assures us that it is \" environmentally friendly \" fake snow so you needn't be troubled by that while watching the picture . ) the music by patrick doyle ( sense and sensibility and henry v ) has a haunting and lovely theme as well as dramatic parts full of kettle drums , horns , and wailing choirs . beautifully sad and majestic music so memorable that you may want to buy the cd , the cinematography by alex thomson makes you feel the warmth of the interior and the cold of the exterior . branagh said he did not want \" gloomy castles and dour costumes , \" and his crew delivered . the sets are as inviting as the text is compelling . branagh is my favorite shakespearean actor and director . anyone doubting his abilities should see his brilliant henry v , which remains his best acting ever . branagh brings an intensity and a focused approach that illuminates every word he speaks . nay it is ; i know not 'seems . ' \" his thin lips quiver as he delivers the lines , and he appears as if he may explode at any moment . every actor puts his stamp on shakespeare's most famous lines , \" to be , or not to be . \" he delivers the speech in a mirror with the camera focused on the mirrored imaged rather than directly on him . as is appropriate , branagh is the star about which the other performers revolve . appropriate both because of his position in the play and because of his talent . nevertheless , the other luminaries in this star studded sky are worth mention and perhaps some oscar consideration . branagh says he purposely cast the film with a host of big names to ensure the audience can \" look and see and hear with greater clarity \" even the minor roles . i want to get the one exception to this rule out of the way quickly since it is my only criticism of the film . luckily , lemmon has only a few minutes of screen time . the rest of the actors range from quite good to exceptional . besides those already mentioned , derek jacobi gives a controlled and effective reading of the malevolent claudius . interesting choice since jacobi's signature role was as emperor claudius in \" i , claudius . \" that performance left an indelible mark on his memory of how the play was so \" exciting , sexy , dangerous , and violent . \" kate winslet ( heavenly creatures , sense and sensibility , and jude ) delivers the best performance of her short but talented career as the fragile and vulnerable ophelia . when ophelia goes mad , you believe it . charlton heston and rosemary harris are perfectly cast as the player king and queen . robin williams is quite funny in the small part of osric , but billy crystal underplays the comic role of the first gravedigger . an incredible motion picture experience . movies this good remind us of the power of the medium . see the four hour version . and try to see the 70mm version that i missed . 70mm gives images a three dimensional realism that the smaller 35mm format can never bring out . i have trouble imagining a more striking visual that the 35mm print i saw . you could see something even better . it is rated pg-13 . there is brief sex , some nudity , and violence . the film would fine for kids say nine or ten and up . i recommend this film to you in the strongest terms whether you like shakespeare or hate him , and i give it my top rating of * * * * . do not miss this film . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",
