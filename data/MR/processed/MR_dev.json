            "message": "john frankenheimer was once recognized as a quality filmmaker capable of making great paranoid thrillers ( the manchurian candidate ) , who has slipped off the precipice of reliability and is now reduced to making this nonsensical , exploitive actioner , that has a bleak metallic snowy look to it . it is made as if to bypass movie houses and go straight to video rentals . it is made from a mindless script . no director , cinematographer , or actor could have made this into a credible film ( well ! replacing affleck as the lead couldn't have hurt in immediately improving it . the film's only purpose seems to be to come up with as many ludicrous plot twists as possible and see if any one in the audience can guess how it will work itself out . the violence is gratuitous and in the last 20 minutes or so , the story proves itself to be an insulting one . the characters became gradually less and less human as the twists kept piling up . the shame of this film , is that it was oddly enough entertaining for long stretches , as it seemed to pass for being a diverting actioner , until it reached the point of no return in tolerability . to say that this film had holes in the script and that everything about the story could be challenged , goes without saying . but things only get more contrived the further along the story moves , so better to forget all the contrivances to the story and try to enjoy the film as is , and take this b- film for what it is . this little ploy will go on for the remainder of the film , as rudy is sometimes nick and sometimes he's just plain rudy . if you think you have seen the main twists , let me warn you , that's just the beginning of all the surprises . the more of them there are , the less sense the film seems to make . john frankenheimer moves the action along at breakneck speed but the more the characters try explaining the ever-changing situations , the more ridiculous the explanations become . then the film tries to pull a complete 360 degree reversal and end on a note of christmas cheer , since i think this is supposed to be some kind of christmas story . what disturbed me more than anything else about the film , which includes its senseless violence and its need for an obligatory nude shot of theron , was the audacity to try and clean up the mess it made , by relating the film's finale to the holiday spirit of giving . it seems to want to spread its desperate gloom over everything it can touch . the thing this film mostly gave me , was a sense of astonishment that frankenheimer , who could still in flashes shoot a scene that is mesmerizing ( the one on the cracked ice with affleck jumping into the chilly water to save theron ) and then follow it up with one that is so dopey ( machine-gunning warfare in a casino that looks like a supermarket ) , that you wonder what happened to the director in a career that spanned 44- years . what compelled him to make such a dumb film as this one !",

'the greek' somehow is running a bordello there . cesare keeps reminding primo , don't be so glum , it is laughter that is the cure all for this misery we have undergone . for primo levi , \" god cannot exist if auschwitz exists . \" as for the film's title , rosi explained , \" life is a truce between the moment we're born and the moment we die . \" i just couldn't help feeling that this earnest attempt at capturing the mood of that horrific event , lacked whatever it takes to make this a first-rate film .",

            "message": "now that doesn't sound too radical , or does it ? nevertheless , the church has not recognized that work and in 1945 declared the work to be a heresy . that is the filmmaker's version , but he's mistaken , it was not declared heretical : upon further research i discovered that the church only said it was simply non-canonical . as for it being unattainable and suppressed by the church , that's hogwash , i've owned a copy of it since the 1970s and anyone can order it in a bookstore . that the film doesn't always stick to its aim and gets mired down in unnecessary subplots , is what disappointed me most about this story that could have been . . . well , great ! that is , if it were in the hands of a filmmaker who was more accurate in his details . the film uses the supernatural as its storyline . this very revealing statement of how inaccurate all the christian icons are magnifies the point the filmmaker is making , that even the eyewitnesses to the event all saw things their own way and to dogmatize them without questioning them , makes for a very questionable religion . director wainright tries hard to make stigmata to be an unconventional film , with a \" hip \" musical score ( smashing pumpkins ) and a mod style of camera shots and montages . by using many different fanciful camera angles , he allows you to feel the pain of the crucifixion while we see nails driven into frankie's wrists . there are many other disturbing images , such as broken glass moved by a spiritual wind , doves appearing out of nowhere , ominous bird feathers , and dripping blood , which add , unfortunately , to the incredibility of the story . during the sequences in which frankie receives her wounds , there are a number of quick cuts between her body in agony and a crucified male , and many slow motion shots emphasizing the agony over and over again . the dazzling cinematography even makes the rainy weather and bad traffic jams of pittsburgh look like an inferno , while it switches gears and goes to the contrasting opulence of the vatican and the poverty of the brazil village , where the faithful flock to the miracle church . though there are many films ( exorcist , rosemary's baby , omen ) trying their hand in this supernatural and religious thriller genre , this film tries a somewhat different look to it ( but those demon voices coming out of frankie , sure sounded like linda blair's possessed voice in the exorcist ) . some of the things the filmmaker tried to do can certainly be questioned as to their effectiveness , especially the over-the-top special effects ( especially weak was the fire during the closing scene , it was overwrought with symbolism and inaccuracies ) and , what might even be a worst cheapening of the film , was the romantic suggestions between the handsome priest and the troubled girl who just wanted to get her life back and \" loves being me . \" in my opinion , these were distractions to an already complicated story , a story if it is to be taken seriously has to remain focused on what it was aiming for and not try to tell more of the corruptions in the catholic church than it could handle . the romantic hints between the two were fine to a certain extent , it made the point that a priest's disavowal of sex has its complications just like sex does for ordinary people . but when it went for overkill and tried to show how human the priest was , that he was more affected by saving the girl's life and giving her love than he was in preserving church dogma , i just thought it became too cheesy to show him in bed with her and ogling her like he was in love with her , that , for me , was going over the top . i have no idea where the director was trying to go with that . it just opened the film up for unnecessary criticism , and i wanted this film to succeed without those kind of distractions because i thought it was onto something . what it had to say was a rational response to such an authoritarian institution that cannot readily accept challenges from within or without . i don't see the story as an anti-religious film , as much as i saw it as a challenge to having one way of looking at religion . in order to challenge the church , there is no doubt that feathers have to be ruffled , but as i saw the film , the catholic community was mostly treated with respect and the essential need for religion was never in question . it is only from the film's ogre , sneeringly played by jonathan pryce , that we see a one-dimensional predictable performance . he is evil from- the beginning to the end- of the film , and how he ends up is just hollywood hokum , leaving me disappointed that the filmmaker would abandon their philosophical argument via the force of ideas and have to resort to making the cardinal look like a strangler . wainwright should have had enough convictions in the strong ideas he presented about his kind of religion being a personal one and should have let the quick lesson he gave us on how the church examines miracles , to be enough of a case against the church and let it go at that . i was mostly impressed with gabriel byrne as a priest . his low-key approach to this role was the glue that held the film together and made it possible for non-believers such as me , to believe that there was some faint hope for the church to actually be spiritual in a universal and unbiased sense . i just couldn't warm up to her sexy dumb hairdresser characterization , it seemed too funky and since she was the brunt of most of the special effects , it all seemed like an exorcist movie going on for too long , losing any rationality and prospective of what this film was supposed to be about . depending on what you are looking for when you view this movie , is what kind of reaction you should have to it . if you view it as a horror movie , then you are in for a big disappointment . this film is more silly than scary , and less funny than risible . but if you look upon it as a challenging religious conspiratory film , the way i saw it , a film that examines the past power structure of the church and the power that the church has today , then you might see a film that is more interesting than you would be led to believe by the way it was advertised and by the way some critics felt that it was their duty to defend the \" poor \" catholic church from such an attack . in any case , i thought the film was not anti- religious , just critical of churchly abuses , which makes it a disturbing film in some circles . in my opinion , despite all its faults , the film is still a thinking man's film . that the church has blindly protested the movie , is of no concern to me . the filmmakers have not disavowed the institution of the church or belief in a god , but just question its search for truth . the film raised some serious questions that should be answered by the church . this film should be seen as an opportunity for the church to see what those who are critical of it are saying and they should not be afraid of the truth , even if it means they have to change . it is easy to lose track that this film is a serious one , despite the mtv feel the movie has to it , and that is what surprised me more than anything else about it . but what makes it fascinating , is why the filmmaker thinks the church can be toppled by this new gospel . in the past the church has always been able to be astute and co-opt anything it gets its hands on , for its own benefit . a better film would have veered away from the sensational and stuck to the nuts and bolts of its argument . but with that being said , it is interesting to hear what the director rupert wainwright says , `it was our goal to present this story as an unbelievable , yet wholly possible phenomenon , ' and like it or not that's what the film does .",

            "message": "the title comes from the markings found on packages delivered by the postal service . the inspiration of the film comes from the studio-like hollywood musicals of the '50s . his other influences are the great french directors of the past , such as renoir and vigo . i rented up down fragile , along with rivette's first feature , paris belongs to us ( 1960 ) , and it was interesting to see how rivette kept some of the same themes , how one has the need to be alone and also the need to be with a group , how one handles reality and fantasy , and the politics of being . in his newer film , which was stylistically and cinematically a much more sophisticated and well-done production than the former , we see these themes come out clearer , brought out by a director who is more assured of his abilities to work with actors on a more experimental basis , as they each collaborate on the script , as he gets them to improvise in their roles . the film follows the life of its three main characters : ninon ( natashe ) , louise ( marianne ) , and ida ( laurence ) , as they try to work out their many problems in life , occasionally breaking out in song and dance at the oddest moments , even when the film is moving along in a dramatic fashion . this lighthearted approach to the film annoyed me on my first viewing , but when i watched the film for a second time , i felt more relaxed and was able to get in the mood rivette probably intended for his film to be viewed ; which is , that it is up to me to fill in the meaning of the story . but , this also , allowed me not to take this film as a very serious work but more or less as a spectacle in the hollywood tradition , a tradition that rivette gladly acknowledges a kinship and admiration for . its entertainment value was enhanced by the gorgeous use of colors , which captured the summertime paris streets and parks , as well as the beautful indoor sets . we followed the moped messenger , ex-whore , ninon , do her deliveries . that this musical is better than most of the hollywood musicals it flatteringly immitates , is true to a certain extent . it is better in the sense , that rivette is able to bring out the poetry of the real-life situations and present his existential view of life and not just play for the song and dance to be the thing . though the hollywood performers are more professional and have better voices and quicker feet , is certainly true , but they also , seem to rely on an artificial story . while for rivette , as amateur as his performers might seem to be in comparison , the story still seems real and important , and the musical numbers are intrusive but seem to be imbued with a magical quality about them , that makes them seem just as fantasy oriented as the typical hollywood production ; and , in my opinion , that makes for a more interesting and better film . though it makes for a different way for american audiences to appreciate the musical , a form of film that hollywood at one time was the most innovative creators of , but has now all but abandoned that genre because of high production costs and not enough box office gross to show for its efforts .",

            "message": "this italian made western , filmed in spain , began the craze of so-called spaghetti westerns . clint eastwood plays 'the man with no name , ' in the first of the three films made with the same theme ( the others were : \" for a few dollars more \" ( 65 ) and \" the good , the bad , and the ugly \" ( 1966 ) ) . the film is a no message one , where violence is glorified by the hero who is as amoral as the villains . this kind of attitude changed the way westerns were made . it's an entertaining film , gore and all , its only drawbacks being the poor dubbing job and that leone hasn't perfected all his moves yet in a smooth way . yet this film , not as rewarding as his others , still has the style of the director's later works , plus the same themes of graphic violence , a laconic hero , and the thrill of gunfights galore . an old bell-ringer tells the newcomer that in this town folks get to be either rich or dead . clint chomps at the end of his cigar without smoking it , says little , wears a mexican poncho , and is always with his trusted . 45s . but this scene was shot in a shoddy way , as it was hard to comprehend that the two gangs were so stupid that they would so easily believe that the stiffs they were fighting over were real . in this western parody , there's some humor behind all the choreographed violence and there's also a passable ennio morricone's score to instill a sense of melodrama . what makes this mythical film noteworthy , is that it serves an historical purpose as the start of a new trend in making westerns .",

            "message": "german-born director michael haneke ( \" funny games \" / \" 71 fragments of a chronology of chance \" ) continues to make fascinating and diverse films about morality . code unknown is a film marked by its documentary style of filmmaking , as it attempts to look in a realistic way at the immigration of people from all over the world to paris . by using shots with long-takes , the director is able to capture in the facial expressions the various moods that strike his subjects . there's an inherent violence in western europe and there's a mixture of races that can easily be seen in the street scenes , the filmmaker tries to see how a modern european city in the midst of such population changes for its white country handles itself . in this episodic film there are several unconnected stories that seem to be leading nowhere , but are followed through at various points of the film ; the film is devoid of plot and relies on the viewer to make their own observations from what unfolds . this is a brilliantly done art film , offering a detached view of immigration according to the way an outsider sees it . it doesn't come to any grand conclusions , at least none that we haven't seen before , but its way of telling its story holds our interest and should be a rewarding film for those who have an interest in observing things in minute details . it was an excellent idea to have a series of long-takes so we can view the african family in action , the romanian woman dealing with her compatriots back in romania and then desperately sneaking back into paris to try and earn some money , and how the french family is also disengaged by the modern times . there's a sense of loss here , but there's also an excitement about what all this change could stir up . some might see it just as a film -- the way binoche views her actress role in the film within the film , who laughs at it when she sees herself on film . there's a special emotional quality about \" code unknown \" that allows paris to be seen in its lies . the film convincingly shows how hard it is for different cultures to communicate with others , and even though this has been said before the film's method of getting to that conclusion is the thing to look for here .",

            "message": "french director eric rohmer's third film is a coming-of-age story , comically looking at the human condition . the beauty in the film is in the natural way the slight story evolves and how tense it gets when love and desire become the main topics that are burning in these very ordinary characters' minds . rohmer is making sport of the adults and how phony they are . the only one who talks with a straight tongue is pauline . the charm in the story is how after all the gossip and lies and perversions pauline sees , she grows up that summer and sees through all the deceits of the adults . rohmer does it without a strong plot but by his ability to have the characters play out who they are in a realistic way , letting their words and actions become examples of how they really are . only pauline comes through this vacation with a worthwhile summer romance . the pleasure in the film is in its simplicity , even if it is not that deep of a story . the natural way it was filmed makes it a pleasant viewing experience , probably reminding the viewer of some similar experience they might have had on the beach .",

            "message": "this is a come to your own conclusion movie , that might be a big let down if you were expecting to see the fable that is presented here come to a necessary resolution , but it is a film that gets better as you step away from it and realize how much intellectual weight there actually was in the telling of its austere story . whatever badii is searching for , this basically is still a philosophical movie , that asks people what is it that they want to get out of life and are they prepared to do something to ensure for themselves a happiness that hasn't been prescribed to them . it also indirectly asks the question , why would any one in good health and being sane , want to kill themselves . if i reply , help me out of the hole . if i don't , cover my body with 20 spadefuls of dirt . we don't really know the reason mr . badii wants to die and we know almost nothing about his personal life , except when he mentions to the poor seminarian he is trying to recruit for the job , that you don't know how someone else feels , you may be able to sympathize with them , but you could never understand their pain . but again , we can only guess at who he is and why he wants to commit suicide , to the director it is obviously not that important , or else he would have provided us with more information . he probably thought like i did , at first , that badii was a pervert trying to pick him up . again , the contrast between the men' silence and the noise from their work is explored . but he cannot do it for the reason that the moslem religion does not permit suicide , and badii's cogent argument , that sometimes by staying alive you do more harm to others than by dying , just falls on deaf ears . mr . bagheri ( baghieri ) is a turk , who talks incessantly , giving the film its lyrical voice it badly needed to counterpoint the tremendously impressive visual scope the film has so far counted on to give it its artistic touch , with its long shots of the barren mountain terrain the soldiers train on and where the workers spend their life on , and its close-ups on badii in his vehicle . then he asks badii , don't you want to taste the cherry ? don't you want to see the dawn and the beauty of the sunset , and the stars and the moon ? as he offers logical reasons for staying alive , that are indisputable . kiarostami' point is that all women are meant to be demeaned by such rigid laws of the state . films are meant to pose questions and not tell stories , is what the director is now telling us , since questions are more important to him , than anything else , they make us think harder about the things we do . my thought about the death of the linear film , as pronounced by the director , is that , if all you did was ask questions , as valuable as they are in the process of educating yourself , you would still end up being the idiot questioner , if that is all you did , question everything , because somewhere along the line , if you are honest with yourself , you will have to take a stand and state what it is you believe , and that statement might come across best in a linear story or some other film format , and not by posing more questions and becoming dogmatic about how a film should be made . why kiarostami might resort to this form of filmmaking , at least for this film , could have something to do with iran's repressive government and their long list of intolerances , that if he openly criticized them , it would probably result in no more kiarostami films for foreigners to adore . i'm a little reluctant to accept any one way of making films , as being the vade mecum of filmmaking , you just try to do what you can , if the film has a magic to it , it will work . i thought the ending of the film was not only a cop out , you don't know for sure if mr . badii committed suicide or not , but it also took the air out of the story's power and made it seem like a tease someone plays on you , first getting your hopes up and then going back on their word . kiarostami was having fun with the audience , and if you weren't in the mood for his jokes , then you might have thought like i did , that it was just too contrived and took away a very good experience i was having , with my imagination working on all cylinders , stimulated by the complexity of the problems raised ; and , by ending the film on that false note , and shooting it on video instead of film , it made it seem to me as if this was not a totally-serious attempt to look at ourselves and the society we live in , as i originally thought it was . if kiarostami thought i needed a break at that point of the film , that i was forgetting that it was just a film i was seeing , then he miscalculated how i felt . but i still believe the film had a potent political message that was delivered subterraneously , a message that is meant to shake us out of the habitual way we look at life ( and at film ) , and fail to recognize how important our dreamworld really is to us . and , in any case , i know from my past experiences with great filmmakers , that sometimes i don't like what i see from them the first time and later on change my mind and see more clearly what they were doing . so i'll leave open the option that my distaste for the film's ending will be subject to change , that is , if that is meant to be so .",

            "message": "winstanley is a truly amazing and painstaking account of misery , as it depicts those whose cause is righteous and nonviolent . the narrative is taken from the pamphlet writings of gerrard winstanley , a gentle , christian radical . he sort of resembles a hippie of the 1970s . the film is based on the book by david caute , \" comrade jacob , \" but has been thoroughly reworked by co-directors brownlow and mollo . his unique filming style , his penchant for austerity , his demand for authenticity , his equalizing of all scenes in importance so that no event sticks out from the others , and his inspired devotion toward looking at the past , perhaps hoping to unearth some missing piece in the puzzle of mankind that keeps the modern world from advancing on the past tragedies , gives this film an air of adventure . lacking the necessary dramatics of films that are more accessible to the general public , this film is nonetheless a work of great intrigue and visual beauty . despite being filmed without the benefit of professional actors , the only professional being jerome willis who played general fairfax , this film has a certain solemnity about it that forces its truths to be seen in the face of the actors . it is brownlow's way of filming such misery , a way that records the diggers' sufferings as if it were the official record of what happened , and probably could pass for what is official . this sense of reality is what gives the film its raw power . it's a lesson in history that is re-created from the words of a journal that allows the directors to look back at the past with a sense of reverence . this film acts as a vehicle to understand what the diggers believed and how they lived , and how they justly thought that the earth was made common property for everyone . that everyone born on earth shall be fed by it and that all are equals in the creation . his performance was beautiful . there is no question , this low budget project , the bfi put up seventeen thousand pounds , achieved the maximum in having an authentic look , even showing the rare breeds of animals , of the time . it showed breeds of pigs and chickens that don't exist today but did during the 17th century . the film's cost is about the same as a james bond film's title scene would cost . the film's cinematographer , ernest vincze , like almost everyone in the film , including the directors , worked for nothing . it doesn't pretend to have the answers , but the questions it raises about the ability of mankind to live and work together , is one worth asking . the message of the film might seem naive or confrontational to many , including the marxists , the bourgeoisie , the film critics looking for a more recognizable kind of film to evaluate , and the common man , bored by what he doesn't want to know . but to others , perhaps the more restless in society , not afraid of ideas , there is a freshness in this work that you can't easily shrug off by pointing to the filmmaker's refusal to be more melodramatic . the scenes were acted with conviction and its lack of hollywood type of poshness actually played to its favor , making the action seem more pertinent . their story is not something you can easily forget in the black-and- white framed shots , taken by a hand-held camera , and in their uncompromising idealism squaring off against self-righteous forces that wanted to crush them , afraid of their new visions for mankind . try comparing winstanley to other period films of the commercial variety , and it is hard not to see how much more real and meaningful this film is . if nothing else , at least , it is a hard film to forget . for the poetic dream of winstanley , for an equitable and more reasonable world , one that is not forged by malice and greed : that is a vision the world is still waiting to see actually happen . this film is available on video by milestone .",

            "message": "mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , violence ) running time : 115 minutes . the general's daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we'll see this year -- or perhaps the stupidest clever film . it's confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction . the punched-up punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the general's daughter has a brain in its head , even as the remaining 75% of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense . if only the sordidness were the worst of the general's daughter's problems . scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary , their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filtered-light sleaze . director simon west likely thinks he's covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers , but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches , which is the film's fatal flaw . it's a trend he continues for two hours , taking the story's few virtues and slapping a coat of moron-proof obviousness over them . bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell . there's something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another . even the lame device of brenner and sunhill's sexual history provides a few winning zingers . goldman's dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than you'll find in most so-called comedies . dialogue , unfortunately , just isn't enough to make a quality script . by the time the general's daughter wanders towards its over-wrought , psycho-in-the-rain finale , west's heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun . it's silly and pretentious film-making , but at least it provides a giggle or five . goldman should tear the 15 decent pages out of this script and turn them into a stand-up routine . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject \" subscribe \" .",

            "message": "screenplay : ronald d . moore and brannon braga . director : david carson . whether or not i would be considered a trekker probably depends on whom you would ask . i have been a fan of both the original series and its recently retired follow-up , as well as the even- numbered entries in the film series . however , i have never been one of those folks who store away trek minutiae and get into debates over the relative merits of spock vs . data . somewhere along the line , the \" star trek \" film series began to seem more and more directed at those in the latter category , and star trek : generations may be the natural conclusion of this direction . its production values may be high , but the writing is frequently appalling , and instead of a script has a collection of references , in-jokes and ill-defined characters . no sooner is it out on its maiden voyage than a distress signal brings them to the nexus , a mysterious ribbon of energy . i don't think it is an insult to fans of \" star trek \" to suggest that to a certain extent , the particulars of a plot are not really the most important elements in a \" trek \" film . but even that interpretation assumes that characterization has to be consistent , and in generations that just doesn't happen . he doesn't get a joke . once the chip is in place , spiner gets to have a lot of fun with data's new emotions , but the point is that he's no longer the data we know . if the rest of the \" next generation \" cast fares any better , it's only because they're on the screen so little that they're simply window dressing . but then again , this story isn't really about the new crew . it's about kirk and picard , the cowboy and the politician , sharing the screen . stewart's edginess is indicative of what may be a very bad sign for paramount's hopes to turn the new cast into the same kind of franchise the original cast was : these are clearly the not ready for big screen players . only thirty years of history can create a moment like that , and that's time this new crew doesn't have . it certainly doesn't help that the plot they are stuck in is so convoluted and badly constructed that you need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find your way out again . it's also loaded with little gags all aimed at those who are familiar enough with the series to turn to all their friends in a shared nudge of recognition . i wonder whether anyone who is coming in cold to the \" trek \" universe at this point would be anything but baffled and bored by what is going on . and what a waste of malcolm mcdowell , who could have been a great monomanical villain but should have been given a much more compelling reason for his obsession . there are plenty of details both scientific and of continuity to pick at , but to do so would be to ignore generations' major flaws . however , i would like to make one recommendation : seatbelts . no , i think the audience might need them more . this journey is one bumpy ride .",

            "message": "accompanying the press materials for curdled were a few newspaper and magazine articles about actual services which clean up violent crime scenes , services like the one which is a key part of the film's premise . if you want a sure sign of an insecure rookie film-maker , that would be it . i suppose the idea is to impress upon us the real-world foundation of the story , but i simply don't care ; an adept film-maker can sell me his premise over the course of his film . what the articles really tell me is that director and co-writer reb braddock found the concept for curdled in real life , and what the rest of the film tells me is that he didn't quite know what to do with it . for a while , curdled is perversely interesting simply because gabriela is such a unique character . she understands enough to know that other people will not consider her obsession normal , but her enthusiasm makes it difficult for her to contain herself , making for some uncomfortable moments with a potential romantic interest ( bruce ramsay ) and with her co-workers . the black humor in the script by braddock and john maass comes from watching jones' off-beat performance as a woman who shows a wide-eyed glee at being right where dark deeds were done . however , even that bit of character development is subverted for a cheap , easy gag . curdled seems to bounce from realism to surrealism with a capricious indifference . ultimately , this confusion points to a director who does not seem to be in control of his material or his characters . there is a lot going on at various points in curdled , but none of it leads anywhere : the central character doesn't grow , there is no real sub-text about human nature , and there is not even a consistent tone to allow it to work as a cathartic genre picture . it is evident that braddock grabbed on to a basic situation with potential , and that he was able to create an intriguing central character to place in that situation , but that he just didn't know where to go from there . curdled sports a few neat stylistic flourishes , including an eye-catching opening title sequence and a great scene where gabriela does a sensuous dance around a murder scene , but for the most part it is just one big , long , sick joke with a punch line that is not particularly worth the effort . someone should have thought about telling a story , instead of just mailing one .",

            "message": "producers : clint eastwood , karen spiegel . director : clint eastwood . when we first encounter luther whitney ( clint eastwood ) in absolute power , he is sitting in an art gallery sketching hands and eyes from paintings in one of those slow , silent moments characteristic of an eastwood-directed film . at that moment , you may be tempted to break into a slight smile , impressed that eastwood has merely fleshed out his character under the guise of plot development . perhaps , you think , this won't be just another plot-driven conspiracy thriller . perhaps three-dimensional characters are going to make it something special . just wait sixty seconds . luther manages to escape , but the president's people know there was a witness . almost any other director would have taken this material and made it a big , dumb hollywood thriller -- and frankly , that probably would have been the best thing for it . eastwood is a director with a precise control over the details of his films , but in absolute power he spends so much time fussing over those details that he fails to notice that the story is completely absurd . while eastwood is able to construct clockwork sequences like an ambush at a coffee shop , he doesn't seem to care that , like much of what goes on in absolute power , it is resolved through pure coincidence . even the casting manages to get in the way , specifically the casting of hackman as richmond . the press notes for absolute power boast of hackman's career that \" there is no such thing as a 'gene hackman role , ' \" but that simply isn't true . it is also hard to figure out how the pathetic , libidinous drunkard of that opening scene becomes the take-charge whip-cracker , or why his press conference in support of his grieving friend sullivan demonstrates such a lousy poker face you wonder what kind of politician this guy could possibly be . the script , by the legendary william goldman , does offer a few nice touches and typically snappy dialogue , and ed harris plays the detective investigating the murder as a courtly and respectful spin on the usual foul-mouthed cop . when a central character seems to be a different person from scene to scene , however , those little details lose a lot of their charm . that brings us to eastwood's luther whitney , as baffling a screen character as i can recall . eastwood's acting has grown more interesting with the passing years , more relaxed and subtle , but he has devoted nearly every ounce of energy in the creation of absolute power to making his own character sympathetic . never mind that before that scene we had no indication that whitney even knew the man in the sullivan house was the president ; in fact , the scene plays funnier and more interesting if whitney is such a recluse that he doesn't even know what the president looks like . but everything is subjugated to giving luther the moral high ground , making him a doting father and a good citizen with a handful of quirky traits . i'm willing to grant the conceit that whitney is a master of disguise even though it doesn't seem particularly necessary for a sneak thief -- maybe he needed a hobby when he tired of sketching the old masters in the smithsonian -- but absolute power lost me when it became clear that this man who could disarm any security system in the world couldn't program a vcr for his alibi .",

            "message": "a few months ago , i was at a press screening for another touchstone film which was preceded by a teaser trailer for mission to mars . as the trailer unfolded , the critics in the audience began to snicker with increasing frequency . the imagery used was startling similar to images from 2001 : a space odyssey -- an astronaut in a white room , an approach to a dark object in the distance , a figure spinning off into space . it was comical not just because of the familiarity , but because it seemed so quintessentially brian de palma . the train station sequence in the untouchables came from eisenstein's potemkin ; the single-take opening sequence in snake eyes felt like welles' touch of evil ; whole heaping chunks of his early films appropriated hitchcockian devices and themes . so why wouldn't de palma take on the most iconic science-fiction film ever made while making his first science-fiction film ? why not add kubrick to his list of victims of auteur homage ? it's more alarming that it's similar to the cookie-cutter hollywood approach to any story . the frustrating thing about any brian de palma film is that you can always count on at least one extended sequence where you realize what a brilliant technical craftsman he can be . a chain reaction of events following that accident keeps building tension , leading to some genuinely tense moments . de palma's sense for timing this sort of sequence is impeccable -- recall the editing of tom cruise's computer room break-in in mission : impossible -- leading to the hope that mission to mars can maintain that sort of visual and emotional energy . and then you remember this is brian de palma . every once in a while , by sheer twisted accident , de palma ends up working with a rich , smart script -- the untouchables , blow out , carlito's way . more often , you get the impression that he looks for a script with a few places he can show off his visual flair . mission to mars has its showcase sequence , but it also has a leaden script full of plug-and-play characterizations . it's the sort of mawkish back-story screenwriters use all the time in adventure films , in a token -- and usually futile -- attempt to show that the people matter more than the concept . ironically , mission to mars is that rare case where the concept does matter more than the people . when mission to mars gets metaphysical , it makes sure there's someone on hand to narrate every brutally obvious revelation , and someone whose individual journey to wholeness will be completed by this close encounter . this film doesn't end with the awe of creation ; it ends with tedious exposition topped off by an interplanetary clasping of hands . there are flashes of brian de palma the visceral thrill-master in mission to mars , but he doesn't seem to know what to do with its limp conclusion . this time around , it probably would have been a good idea . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject \" subscribe \" .",

            "message": "screenplay : kenneth lonergan , based on characters created by jay ward . producers : jane rosenthal and robert deniro . director : des mcanuff . mpaa rating : pg ( cartoon violence , mild profanity ) running time : 88 minutes . the adventures of rocky and bullwinkle is _not_ a bloated big-screen vehicle that misses the point of its source material entirely . indeed , the opening five minutes represent a surprsingly clever brand of self-awareness , the kind that promises a brisk and satisfying stroll dose of cartoon nostalgia . from the outset , it's clear that this is jay ward's rocky and bullwinkle , complete with adult references , howlingly awful puns and still more howlingly awful puns . could this finally be the kind of live-action cartoon hollywood has been trying to make for years , only to botch the job over and over again ? believe me , i wanted to get giddy over the adventures of rocky and bullwinkle , which opens with protagonists rocket j . squirrel and bullwinkle j . moose . it's a funny idea , as is the idea of fearless leader's plot to entrap a hollywood producer ( janeane garofolo ) by offering the movie rights to \" rocky and bullwinkle . \" jay ward's cartoons were always a strangely deft mix of smart and silly , which is a fairly accurate description of the adventures of rocky and bullwinkle for a few hundred blissful seconds . then , inevitably and tragically , we leave the hand-drawn world for something considerably more drab . whatever twisted force convinces studio executives that the flintstones , 101 dalmatians or rocky and bullwinkle have something more to offer us with human actors is in need of immediate exorcising . there's something about an animated world , even a crudely-drawn animated world , that changes the rules ; ward could get away with groaners that would make you want to stuff a sock in a human mouth that uttered them . it certainly doesn't help that some of the human actors appear befuddled by the whole enterprise . rene russo waits for about half an hour before she gets to utter a word of dialogue , and still looks like she's waiting around for the rest of the film . as for newcomer piper perabo , what little comedic timing she may have isn't enhanced by acting opposite a pair of visual effects . deniro has fun with fearless leader , but it's not nearly enough . a self-deprecating gag referring to who framed roger rabbit ? doesn't change the fact that roger's concept was made for its format , and vice-versa . rocky and bullwinkle are cartoons in a human world simply because they could be . there are more than a few decent gags in playwright kenneth lonergan's script for rocky and bullwinkle -- the title of fearless leader's perfectly awful televsion series will set me to giggling for a few days -- and a lack of bombast that makes it infinitely easier to swallow . it's also a cheerful film that's perfectly suitable for kids , even as it offers tidbits for adults . there's just something inescapably , inherently wrong about turning these characters into cgi wise-crackers who interact with whoopi goldberg , john goodman and all the other cameo actors trotted out for our knowing amusement . the adventures of rocky and bullwinkle may be close to the best live-action film that could be made with these characters , and that's not saying much . call it a draw . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject \" subscribe \" .",

            "message": "screenplay : barry schneider & richard hawley . director : yves simoneau . hey , mr . development executive , have i got a pitch for you . now here's the casting twist : jamie lee curtis , scream queen ingenue of late 70s/early 80s horror films as the * villain * . give it a french director and some moody photography to make it look more respectable , and voila ! you've got a bona fide hit on your hands , right ? well , probably not . mother's boys occupies that unfortunate middle ground between teen scarefest and pop phenom psychothriller , inevitably limiting its audience . it also swings wildly from the subtly creepy to the just-plain-dumb . robert will have none of it , but jude is more than determined--she's sociopathic . mother's boys is one of those movies where it's easy to spend a lot of time picking apart flaws in logic , if logic is something you expect from your thrillers . i suppose it would have been too stereotypical for callie to be * just * a teacher . then there are silly details like the band-aid which is supposed to cover the cut on jude's forehead , and \" cliche alert \" problems like the use of not one , not two , but * three * nightmare sequences . the script is sloppy in its attempt to explain jude's pathology , and the character development is virtually non-existent . yet for all that , mother's boys still almost won me over on style points alone . from the eye-catching opening credits to the climax , director yves simoneau gives the production a smoky , dreamlike atmosphere which maintains tension throughout . the story is thankfully short on gothic excess , and i was pleasantly surprised by the twist to jude's plan . jamie lee curtis is generally well- directed , veering into the overblown only rarely . finally , it leaves kes at a point of uncertainty , a rarity in films of any kind . while it may not have done much for my brain , mother's boys did get my skin crawling . what disappointed me about mother's boys was that i thought it made the wrong choices about jude . once the choice was made to go in the latter direction , mother's boys committed itself to being a thriller , and ultimately it's not that scary . how much more interesting it would have been to watch jude turn all three boys against callie , be more subtle in her seduction of robert , or make callie want to leave .",

            "message": "something happens when innovative , independent directors \" go hollywood , \" and it's not usually a good something . some directors are ready-made for the pressures and compromises involved in working with big stars and big budgets ; others are so clearly out of their element that you can see them straining against the strictures of studio projects . sam raimi , director of the goofy and off-beat evil dead films , was hand-picked by sharon stone to helm the quick and the dead , and it looks like he had some interesting ideas about how to turn it inot a cock-eyed parody of spaghetti westerns . instead , it's not played with enough of a wink , and it becomes an extremely repetitive story muddled by tone shifts and unnecessary sub-plots . a few of the early gunfights are handled with typical raimi panache , including liberal use of the trackback/zoom in camera movement utilized by hitchcock and spielberg most notably . everywhere there are glimpses of raimi's twisted sense of humor , nowhere more so than in a gunfight which ends with the loser staring down at his shadow and noticing a hole in it . but that's all we get in the quick and the dead -- glimpses . where raimi wants self-awareness , screenwriter simon moore delivers a fairly standard western revenge saga . the story has potential , and particularly when a flashback reveals the source of ellen's grief there is evidence of some compelling psychological background . the relationship between cort and herod might have been exploited better , but for the most part cort is playing a part culled entirely from eastwood's penitent gunslingers in pale rider and unforgiven . and this is the real knock on the quick and the dead : without a real focus on raimi's satirical sensibilities and acrobatic camera tricks , it's just a less-than-mediocre knock-off of eastwood's oeuvre . gene hackman is a marvelous villain , oozing despicable charm , but his presence only magnifies the comparisons to unforgiven , and when he exposes a boastful gunman ( lance henriksen ) as a fraud , it sounds exactly like his debunking of english bob's self-aggrandizing tales in that earlier film . sharon stone is surprisingly effective as the haunted vengeance-seeker , but ultimately she too is lost in a story that doesn't really seem to have a sense of purpose . the quick and the dead boasts some fine cinematography by dante spinotti and a wonderfully dilapidated production design , and they could have been used in the service of a nice piece of parody . unfortunately , raimi couldn't or wouldn't let the throttle out , and the quick and the dead stalls when it's played far too straight .",

            "message": "mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 104 minutes . albert brooks is a rather odd case as a film-maker . on the one hand , he goes years between projects , has loyal and generally intelligent fans and never has had a really big commercial success . brooks is like a hybrid of woody allen and ivan reitman , a writer/director too smart and eccentric to get maximum mileage out of his marketing-friendly plots . mother is a perfect example of brooks' nose for high-concept , but for once he doesn't work any particular magic with it . riding on the familiarity of his situations and a wicked performance by debbie reynolds , brooks turns out an amusing but uneven domestic comedy . john determines that all of his failed relationships have had certain elements in common , and that those elements might be traceable to his upbringing . much of the appeal of mother -- most of the appeal , to be frank -- comes from the character of beatrice henderson , less as created by brooks than as realized by reynolds . there are moments when brooks verges on condescension towards his older female characters -- an encounter with neighbors in a grocery store is both funny and rather embarrassing -- but debbie reynolds salvages every one by giving her line readings an intelligent twist . even when beatrice is fumbling with technology or circling a parking lot past the one available space , she never comes off as dim or pathetic . with a professionalism showing no signs of rust after a long layoff from screen acting , reynolds wrestles a laundry list of motherly quirks into a wonderful character . this achievement comes almost in spite of brooks' script , which has plenty of funny lines but too little narrative direction . the goodwill generated by the main premise carries mother a surprisingly long way , but brooks doesn't do all that much with it . the film is full of situations with great comic potential , most of which inspire a chuckle and little more because brooks prefers wry observation to outrageousness . it is a scene which primes you for a huge laugh -- a man , his mother , lingerie . . . can you feel the giddy tension rising ? -- then dissolves after yet another good-natured chuckle . mother is full of moments , like a scene where john channel-surfs through a succession of info-mercials , where brooks seems to be waiting for a punch line to formulate itself instead of attacking the set-up to provide a payoff . mother is almost always an entertaining film , but it is not nearly as subversive as it could have been , or as flirting with disaster was covering similar ground of warped familial relations . perhaps the problem is that the script does not launch itself from full , rich characterizations . in fact , as the story unfolds , it seems that brooks has constructed his story around psychological case studies rather than people . every time mother does something exasperating , john deconstructs it in search of its deeper significance . the result is frustrating , as though brooks were telling jokes then stopping after each one to explain why it was just as sad as it was funny . it is one of the characteristics which makes brooks unique as a film-maker that he builds his climax around a moment of insight rather than a wacky car chase , but there has to be a middle ground . debbie reynolds takes mother's high-concept and gives it high energy , making it a film anyone who has had a mother could like , but perhaps only a mother could love .",

            "message": "director : peter hewitt . mpaa rating : pg ( mild vulgarity ) running time : 83 minutes . the borrowers is the kind of goofy charmer of a family adventure film hollywood should be able to make it its sleep , if only it would bother . the premise posits the existence of 4-inch-tall beings called borrowers who live beneath the floorboards and in the walls of human homes , making their living off the bits and pieces we always seem to be misplacing -- a loose button for a plate here , a sock for a bed there . first : why can't more films employ special effects with the borrowers' unobtrusive whimsy ? visual effects supervisor peter chiang , production designer gemma jackson and cinematographers john fenner and trevor brooker have joined forces to fashion a warm , visually enthralling world for the film's characters , in which the oversized props and camera trickery serve a purpose besides calling attention to themselves . humans and borrowers interact convincingly , creating wild and thoroughly entertaining set pieces . it's a great-looking , lively piece of work with neat bits of throwaway business -- a monopoly card hung on the clocks' wall like a pop art showpiece -- and a crisp pace . the second , more disspiriting question : when and why did it become obligatory for every children's film to aim for cheap chuckles from bodily functions ? for most of its running time , the borrowers' slapstick comedy is disarming in its cartoonish innocence -- foam in the face , cheese on the head , exaggerated electrocutions and pratfalls . why , then , do we need to see peagreen immersed in a massive pile of dog droppings ? why the running gag about a flatulent hound ? is it really so difficult to fill 83 minutes with entertainment a parent can share with a child sans embarassment ? there's so much immagination throughout the borrowers that it's even more disappointing to find it swinging so typically below the belt . there's nothing particularly ground-breaking about the basic story-line of the borrowers , which melds the recent mouse hunt with a teen alienation sub-plot as arietty longs to find other borrowers . the appeal of the film comes not from narrative wackiness , but from the complementary pairing of john goodman's snarling villainy with the storybook delights of the film's overall look and feel . sure , it stumbles occasionally in the ways its most like most ostensibly \" family films \" of recent years . it's the ways in which the borrowers is least like its genre cousins which should make it satisfying matinee viewing . this is fantasy escapism which doesn't make you feel stupid for escaping . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line \" subscribe \" .",

            "message": "screenplay : richard curtis . director : mike newell . where romantic comedy is concerned , i am a tough sell . too many of them seem to put across the impression that all you need to do is put two people on the screen and have them end up together , regardless of whether or not they are developed with an interesting conflict ( or even speak to one another , as in the monstrously overhyped sleepless in seattle ) . i'm not going to turn into a pile of goo every time i see a screen kiss , but i will respond if i've spent two hours with two well-developed characters who seem to belong together . the new british comedy four weddings and a funeral delivers only halfway . hugh grant turns in a charming , star-making performance in this uneven character piece , but andie macdowell always appears to be more of a prop than a person . four weddings and a funeral was written by richard curtis , co-creator of the popular british television import \" black adder , \" a series not renowned for its sentimentality . and four weddings is extremely winning when it's not focusing on relationships . there are enough of these lively set pieces that four weddings rarely lags for too long , and the laughs come at fairly regular intervals . part of the problem is that in an attempt to create yet another ensemble friends piece he overloads the film with supporting characters , giving short shrift to the crucial relationship between charles and carrie . only james fleet , as befuddled aristocrat tom , provides any spark to the proceedings . the simple fact is that i kept losing track of the relationships between all these people , and didn't particularly care when i could figure them out . this lack of focus is inexcusable considering the cursory treatment carrie's character is given . part of four weddings and a funeral's message about love is that we should all be looking for that one person who makes \" lightning strike , \" and while the romantic sentiment is laudable it also assumes that we as an audience should recognize it when we see it . hugh grant , looking frighteningly like harold lloyd in his horn-rims , is an absolute delight ; he turns charles into a wonderful , funny , fallible character , and we want to see him happy . but carrie is simply a plot device . we know virtually nothing about her except that charles has a crush on her , and andie macdowell is not subtle enough an actress to fill in the blanks . it also might have been helpful to understand charles' romantic history better , which could have been accomplished through a more complete picture of ex-girlfriend henrietta , but that too is absent . there is much to recommend four weddings and a funeral as a comedy ; it's bright and spirited and well-paced . as a romance , it leaves much to be desired . . . primarily a second party for the romantic pairing .",

            "message": "screenplay/director : kevin smith . for the past few years , filmmakers have been trying to capture what it is that defines the generation which has thus far been difficult even to name . so-called \" generation x \" films like singles ; bodies , rest & motion ; and reality bites have tried , but their target audience seems to have rejected those attempts . at first glance , clerks appears to be cut from the same cloth , a bargain basement variation on tales of cynical , over-qualified and under-achieving whiners . made for a paltry $36 , 000 by writer/director kevin smith , clerks frequently shows its low-budget roots in performances which can charitably be called amateurish . brian o'halloran has an easy-going and engaging presence , but he's often far too broad in his physical acting . only lisa spoonhauer as the sexy and sharp caitlin puts much real spark into her performance . smith's direction is simple , but his insistence on swinging his camera back and forth in two-character scenes also proves distracting . like go fish earlier this year , clerks is occasionally just a bit too clunky to be completely endearing . the episodes which make up clerks are of inconsistent quality , but the good ones are very good . the dialogue is filled with ultra-crude observations which almost earned clerks an nc-17 rating , but they're caustic and on-target . randal in particular , who acts both as the devil on dante's shoulder and as the real voice of reason in clerks , gets some marvelous lines , though virtually every one of them is unprintable . less effective are sequences involving a roller hockey game on the store's roof which simply lasts too long , and a montage of annoying customer types which is a bit is too cutesy . but clerks turns out to be more than just the sum of its parts . kevin smith places himself in the awkward position of chastising those who are most likely to be his audience , and it is that daring that makes clerks most worthy of admiration ; it is not often that personal responsibility is the moral to a story . while he may not have had all the tools at his disposal that a studio filmmaker would have had to tell this story , kevin smith did have a story to tell . clerks is unquestionably uneven , but it is also a very funny wake-up call to the over-the-counter culture .",

            "message": "screenplay : kevin williamson . director : wes craven . mpaa rating : r ( violence , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 105 minutes . in the late 70s and early 80s , theater screens were overrun by a film genre which had primarily teenage audiences filling the seats and sociologists shaking their heads . it was the golden age -- if that isn't a gross misapplication of the term -- of the slasher movie , where cutlery-wielding crazies turned every possible day on the calendar ( halloween , friday the 13th , prom night , mother's day , my bloody valentine ) into a stomach-churning ordeal . these films usually differed only in the manner of the violent killings , leading to a numbing predictability deserving only of parody . wes craven's scream wants to have some fun with the conventions of the slasher movie , but not at the expense of providing a few scares of its own . that presents problems as well as opportunities , as the self-aware script sometimes diffuses the tension craven can create as a director . in scream , the students at woodsboro high are facing more profound problems than the usual homework and bad skin . as scream begins , it looks like it is going to be a fairly conventional horror film , if an unusually gripping one . most of the familiar tropes of the slasher movie are in place -- the absentee parents , the improbably massive house with plenty of glass , the ever-alarming ringing phone -- but the sequence is still scary stuff , with barrymore providing an effective and convincing portrait of mounting panic . though much of scream becomes a joke at the expense of monotonously violent horror films , craven is not about to spit in the face of the genre which made his career . horror films in general are not the target in scream -- horror films with no style or imagination are , and craven provides both throughout the film , though nowhere as effectively as the opening . what happens between the scares is what gives scream its knowing edge . kevin williamson's script is loaded with references to horror films -- it seems that half a dozen are aimed at craven alone -- and loaded with characters who have seen other horror films . many of those references are spelled out quite literally , and they are the least interesting . some of the most subversive humor is the least obvious , however . scream plays with expectations effectively , making the guessing game part of the in-joke . the guessing ends in a climax which , while certainly surprising , isn't particularly effective . it is also excessively drawn out , as writer and director seem to engage in an ideological battle over whether it is going to be the climax to a horror film or a commentary on the climaxes of horror films . in the end it is both , which is to say that it is neither . some of the gags are quite funny , but the suspense all but vanishes in the final fifteen minutes as the characters talk their way through a comparison of this finale to the traditional finale . the script for scream is not clever enough to provide a consistently witty thriller ; it is sometimes witty and sometimes thrilling , but never both . that alone makes scream stand out from its genre cousins , though , as wes craven reminds us that terror can be fun , and not simply a grueling march through gore-spattered holidays .",

            "message": "screenplay : leslie bohem . director : roger donaldson . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , intense situations ) running time : 105 minutes . i have been anticipating the arrival of dante's peak , the first of 1997's two volcano films , with a combination of dread and . . . well , still more dread . the return of the disaster film has been about as welcome a pop culture phenomenon as 70s nostalgia , both of them reincarnating uncalculated vapidity as calculated vapidity . it only takes one twister to turn you off the genre ; throw in independence day and daylight and any critic could be excused for walking into dante's peak with an attitude . but if i have to sit through more disaster films , i only hope they can be as thrilling as dante's peak . though just as plot- and character-impaired as its genre cousins , dante's peak delivers a solid hour of relentless tension and excitement . dante's peak is a strange kind of success , because it includes many of the noteworthy flaws of twister , and then some . we get the same obligatory romantic pair thrown into danger with a minimalist back-story tagged on , along with a team of quirky scientists to provide comic relief . brosnan is ruddy and somber for most of the film's running time , hamilton is frazzled and likeable , and both of them trudge dutifully through fifty minutes of exposition as though any unnecessary acting might tire them out before the big finish . leslie bohem ( the scripter of record on daylight , apparently a specialist in films which end with traumatized people wrapped in heavy blankets ) also adds a dose of jaws , but doesn't give us the pleasure of an actual villain . charles hallahan provides the political voice who ends up causing more damage , and there is a teasing sub-plot about a potentially skittish business developer . neither one offers enough conflict , however , forcing the audience to sit and wait out the plodding first half for the big show . and what a show it turns out to be . the surprising thing about the post-eruption second half of dante's peak isn't necessarily that it is effective , but that the reason for its effectiveness doesn't exist entirely on a hard drive somewhere . there are certainly a few impressive visual effects sequences , including a cloud packing the concussive force of a small nuclear weapon , but director roger donaldson gets just as much mileage out of the time-honored technique of jiggling the camera to represent an earthquake . no , dante's peak is an effective thriller because the characters repeatedly find themselves in new and apparently impossible situations , and the direction gives those sequences an edge-of-the-seat tension . from a dizzying truck ride through town destined for the universal studios tour , to the crossing of a flood-threatened bridge , to a mine shaft which threatens to turn brosnan into a sardine , dante's peak provides the kind of relentless , well-crafted action which is what movie-goers should be talking about when they talk about certain films being like roller-coasters . the biggest surprise of all may be that the man behind that action is donaldson , who has served up cinematic backwash like species , the getaway and cocktail . it is an eerie moment , and donaldson manages to get you itching for the fate of the characters even though they haven't been given any personalities . more impressive still , he does it without assaulting your senses . there is , however , something rare in a film which can generate the kind of tension dante's peak generates . maybe it is possible to present a disaster without being one .",

            "message": "watching the most infectious comic moment in the british import the full monty -- a film rich with infectious comic moments -- can teach you a lot about what so many hollywood comedies get so wrong . it's a wonderful bit of comic film-making , surprisingly restrained and staged with impeccable momentum and timing . it also comes in a context which gives the laughter more bite . their spontaneous burst of energy in that dole queue is a physical manifestation of optimism . they're trying something to become men again , by god , even if it's as ridiculous a notion as dropping trou -- or going \" the full monty \" in brit-speak -- in front of 400 howling women . now i'm not saying it isn't worth several chuckles simply watching the out-of-shape mates muddle their way through their pirouettes and pelvic thrusts ; incongruity is the mother of classic physical comedy . i'm willing to wager , however , that a hollywoodized version of the full monty would miss the point entirely . in this hypothetical american monty , the idea of six working-class blokes becoming strippers , none of them ideal physical specimens , would be treated as inherently hilarious . it would become a broad farce , with chris farley re-creating his \" saturday night live \" sketch challenging patrick swayze for a spot in the chippendales line-up . the full monty isn't an effective comedy because the stars are unattractive . it's an effective comedy because the characters _are_ attractive , because their dilemma is genuine and their solution is ripe with possibilities . ironically , the most noteworthy flaws in the full monty might have been erased by a good old hollywood script doctoring . screenwriter simon beaufoy dangles a few too many plot threads for no apparent reason , including a gay romance which never matters much to the story . dramatic confrontations interfere with the comedic flow , as though beaufoy didn't trust the performances and basic plot situations to generate enough sympathy for his characters . though not nearly as pedantic as the similarly-themed brassed off ! , the full monty still treads dangerously close to pathos at times , clashing with the lads' growing enthusiasm for their new calling . the full monty may be a high-concept premise , but the execution is resolutely low-concept . that's a combination hollywood is having a tough time putting together in its comedies . comedy with ideas doesn't have to be leaden ; comedy with big laughs doesn't have to be simple-minded . the full monty gives depth to dole-line disco . . . _that's_ high comedy . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line \" subscribe \" .",

( niggaz with hats ) , whose members are rappers ice cold ( rusty cundieff ) and tasty taste ( larry b . scott ) and dj tone def ( mark christopher lawrence ) . in terms of plot structure , it often seems that writer/ director/star rusty cundieff decided simply to \" colorize \" spinal tap . it is not simply the framing device which is borrowed , but a multitude of specific details : gigs with somewhat insulting billing on the marquis ; internal squabbles triggered by a domineering girlfriend ; tap's series of ill-fated drummers replaced by n . w . h .

            "message": "with certain movies , it's possible to tell immediately that you're watching something memorably bad . with others , you have to wait a little longer . in bad moon , it takes approximately three minutes . the first shot -- a stunning widescreen view of a mountainscape , complete with mist-shrouded jungle -- is actually quite impressive . it's what happens shortly thereafter that makes it apparent how low the standards of quality are on this production . after a brief sex scene ( is it possible to have a horror film without at least a little bare female flesh ? ) , we're treated to our first view of a werewolf . at that supposedly-chilling moment , i started laughing so hard that i nearly fell out of my chair . in this era of morphing , cgi , and other futuristic special effects , bad moon put someone into an exceptionally cheesy-looking wolf man suit . i spent a good portion of the rest of the film looking for the zipper . it's this kind of movie that somehow restores one's faith in hollywood -- they can still make movies that are so completely awful that , on a masochistic level , they're a riot to watch . people occasionally ask me why i venture into films that i fully expect to be bad ; this is the reason . and , as an added bonus , bad moon doesn't drag its hideousness out to the point where it becomes unbearable . at just eighty minutes ( seventy-five if you ignore the end credits ) , it's over before the urge to walk out becomes irresistible . there are a few points i'd like to raise about this movie . first of all , even though ted claims that it doesn't take a full moon to force the transformation of a real werewolf , in this film , the moon is always full . on at least three consecutive nights , we're shown shots of it , hanging in the sky , emerging from behind clouds , full and round . i would think such a bizarre astronomical event would cause far more interest than the comparatively mundane occurrence of a man changing into a werewolf . not a bad idea , right ? if he still has the keys , then why doesn't he use them as a werewolf ? somehow , i don't think we're supposed to think about this . finally , it's pretty amazing that on the one morning ted is spending some quality time with brett and janet , a werewolf movie just happens to be on tv . the actors probably shouldn't have played their roles quite so solemnly . a little more tongue-in-cheek would have improved the tone immeasurably . then again , almost anything would have accomplished that aim . i'm not sure why bad moon didn't go straight to video . don't worry , though , if you're planning to subject yourself to it in that medium -- it will arrive there faster than a speeding bullet , silver or otherwise .",

            "message": "despite his immense popularity on stage , rodney dangerfield doesn't have a sterling reputation as a motion picture lead . with the exception of back to school , a delightfully dumb 1986 comedy , every movie to feature dangerfield prominently ( caddyshack , easy money , ladybugs ) has been a dud . meet wally sparks , a lame , late-january film dumped into a sluggish market , may well finish the aging comic's screen career . there's nothing in this movie that warrants the price of a video rental , much less a trip to a theater . generally , about the best one can hope for from a dangerfield movie is a cliched storyline filled with crude-but-humorous gags and one- liners . that is , after all , basically what back to school delivered , and it worked on that basis . meet wally sparks never comes close , because there's hardly a laugh to be found from start to finish . it amazes me that dangerfield , who in the past has been able to make the simple act of walking into a room funny , has turned out such a dreadful motion picture . meet wally sparks is easily among the ten worst comedies i've seen in the past two years . it's hard to put a finger on why dangerfield isn't funny here . he certainly doesn't seem to have invested his character , tabloid talkshow host wally sparks , with much vitality . the sex jokes , even when you can't see them coming , are old and tired , as if we've heard them a few times too many . this shtick is worn-out ; it might still work in comedy clubs , but any spontaneity is lost on screen . and , unfortunately , the one or two potentially-amusing moments have been shown to death in the previews , so their comic effect is ruined . even dangerfield's intention of lampooning the current generation of talk shows isn't successful . without that quality , there's little chance for satire to be effective . yet probably the worst thing about wally sparks is its failed attempts to inject character development and human interest into a one-dimensional story . by aiming for pathos , this movie comes across as pathetic . once the credits have concluded , however , it's all downhill -- fast . the film's premise involves wally toning down his show to stem the tide of deserting sponsors . enduring meet wally sparks is akin to watching a multi-car pileup , as each successive failure leads to a bigger thud . by the end of the movie , i didn't know whether to feel angry at being subjected to such a loathsome experience , or saddened and embarrassed for dangerfield and the others involved . by his own admission , rodney's not a happy person , and the public and critical response to meet wally sparks isn't likely to bring much sunshine into his life . this is truly a movie that doesn't deserve any respect .",

            "message": "sad to say , most wanted is yet another poorly-executed government conspiracy thriller , joining the lackluster ranks of shadow conspiracy , murder at 1600 , and conspiracy theory . most wanted is intended as a vehicle for keenan ivory wayans , action hero ( as opposed to keenan ivory wayans , talented comic ) . but , while wayans the actor has an undeniable screen presence , wayans the writer lets him down . not only is the screenplay for most wanted laughably absurd , but it contains line after line of the worst dialogue available in any film currently on a multiplex screen . yet the film makers still expect us to take most wanted seriously . in general , action films are not known for their intelligence , but this one takes assumptions of the audience's stupidity a little too far . for a movie this dimwitted to succeed , it has to keep viewers under a constant barrage of pyrotechnics , gunfire , chases , and other assorted thrills . it can't allow them a moment's pause to actually think . inexplicably , this is not first time director david glenn hogan's approach . so , although the action sequences are all well-choreographed , there are significant pauses between them . the film makers have foolishly inserted exposition into those dead zones , and the more we learn about the conspiracy underlying most wanted , the more we realize it would be better left unexplained . the movie opens with an offer . it's supposed to be a clean , quick operation , but it doesn't go that way . the conspiracy here has many levels , and the more diligently you try to figure out exactly what's going on , the more apparent it becomes how ludicrous the entire scheme is . most wanted features some adequate action sequences , but nothing that can suitably camouflage the weakness of the plot . wayans does the best he can with the role , but he only has himself to blame for its limitations . jon voight , who lately seems to be choosing roles that allow him to chew the scenery ( check out anaconda and u-turn for other examples ) , goes at it full-throttle here , recalling images of james woods and donald sutherland at their most over-the-top . jill hennessy ( a smile like yours ) is bland but attractive as dunn's hostage-turned-sidekick . and paul sorvino's quietly dignified performance is completely wasted . i'm getting bored of dumb action movies , and there have been far too many of them this year . when i go into a theater to see explosions and shootouts , i don't look for a script that resembles shakespeare , but i expect it to make sense and keep my attention . most wanted does neither . it's a poor excuse for entertainment , and , in the wake of the glimmer man , this has me seriously wondering about keenan ivory wayans' choice of motion picture material . \" for me , the cinema is not a slice of life , but a piece of cake . \"",

            "message": "about the nicest thing i can say about a steven seagal film is that the average offering from the man who personifies wooden acting is more entertaining than sitting in traffic . fire down below , seagal's latest ( which seems just like his next-to-latest ) , is just about average . it offers what seagal fans have come to expect from their icon : a healthy dose of ego and a lot of fights in which no one ever lays a finger on the star . it's a known fact that the more violent a seagal movie is , the more enjoyable it is . to that end , fire down below could have used a few more fight scenes to cut down on such unimportant irritants as the laughable attempts at plot and character development . let me say up front that i believe seagal to be totally sincere in his concern for the environment , but it strikes me that preaching about it in an action film is not the best arena . it's not only a distraction , but it comes across as both sanctimonious and hypocritical . ( it's okay for seagal to beat the crap out of anyone who looks cross-eyed at him , but don't you dare dump that glowing green stuff down a mine shaft ! ) his means -- any and all necessary , and the more violent , the better . there's also an obligatory love interest , played with a distinct lack of enthusiasm by marg helgenberger , and a dull sidekick who is listlessly essayed by the normally-reliable harry dean stanton . seagal must demand that actors in his films discard any inherent talent so there's no threat of stealing scenes from him . however , by including an incest subplot and creating so many idiotic , cartoonish villains for seagal to beat up , it actually reinforces the unflattering image . at one point , taggart makes a comment about possibly coming to live in the area . i think we're supposed to infer that he's in awe of the beauty of the appalachians , but it seems more likely that he has been seduced by the thought of so many readily-available punching bags . the action scenes are adequately directed ( by felix enriquez alcala , a tv director making the crossover to feature films ) , and there's a genuinely tense truck-and-car chase that is worth about 90 seconds of moderate excitement . the rest of the film is all by-the-book stuff , but that's what's expected whenever the name \" steven seagal \" tops the marquee . \" the cinema is not an art which films life : the cinema is something between art and life . unlike painting and literature , the cinema both gives to life and takes from it . . . \" - jean-luc godard",

( actually , that was one of the movie's funnier moments . ) i'm not sure what audience polanski aimed this movie at , but i'm obviously not in the target group . once the overly-long narrative had concluded , i felt nothing but apathy for the characters , themes , and situations presented therein .",

            "message": "it goes without saying that no one walks into a film adaptation of a kafka novel expecting something created for general consumption . the trial , however , takes this a step further , as significant portions of the narrative are impossible to comprehend without an intimate knowledge of the author and his works . the book is strange ; the movie , even stranger . the trial is a visually impressive motion picture , with many beautifully framed , gothic-like shots of prague , where it was filmed . kyle maclachlan plays the part of josef k with an icy detachment that makes the character seem all too like another maclachlan personality--that of twin peaks' agent cooper ( odd how the actor seems to gravitate to bizarre projects ) . unfortunately , cooper and josef aren't anything alike , and mr . maclachlan's aloofness creates a schism between the audience and josef--it's difficult , if not impossible , to identify with the trial's protagonist . and what in the world is that on-and-off accent supposed to be ? certain minor themes of the film are easily recognizable--those of the corruption of justice and the dehumanization of society--but the overall message of the trial remains murky . in a key scene near the end , anthony hopkins delivers a lengthy parable that is supposed to clear things up , but this sequence is so cryptic that it can easily leave the viewer even more confused than before . high production values and good acting aren't everything . the film lacks energy , and comes across as a pedantic , obtuse , two-hour nightmare . since the intentions of this film ( and the novel from which it was adapted ) do not come across clearly , \" what's the point ? \" kafka aficionados will likely find a great deal to chew over , but most everyone else will be baffled and perhaps even a little annoyed .",

            "message": "tales from the crypt presents bordello of blood it's curious how one of the most inventive made-for-cable tv series ( hbo's tales from the crypt ) could turn into one of the most toothless movie series to haunt multiplexes . bordello of blood is the second tales from the crypt feature , following in the dismal wake left by 1995's demon knight , one of that year's worst pictures . at least this followup keeps to the basic sprit of the program that spawned it . bordello of blood is a macabre , jokey affair that could give buffy the vampire slayer a run for its money as the silliest undead story of the decade . comic dennis miller is on hand as rafe guttman , the hero of the piece . miller , who got bumped off early in the net , stays around much longer here , which is fortunate , since his wisecracking is bordello of blood's most obvious asset . miller makes this movie ; without him , i would be fishing for nice things to say . several of his one-liners are legitimately funny , and the offhand manner in which he confronts the vampires is worth at least a smile . chris sarandon plays a rather dull televangelist . the film makes a lot of jokes at the expense of the religious right , but , considering that it's such an easy target , the humor seems recycled . frankly , there isn't much of a plot . the exposition exists for three purposes : to gather a lot of half-naked women together , to display as much gore as can be crammed into ninety minutes ( actually , from dusk till dawn's total probably tops bordello of blood's ) , and to give miller an arena for his verbal ripostes . the whole thing works in a campy sort of way , but this movie definitely should not be confused with \" good \" cinema . just because it's bad , though , doesn't mean that it can't have a certain entertainment value . presumably , that's exactly what the film makers intended . men go in , but they don't come out -- at least not in one piece . they are , i presume , too worked up by lilith's unique method of french kissing . it's a heartfelt sort of activity . i'm almost embarrassed to admit that i liked parts of bordello of blood -- it is , after all , a pretty sick motion picture . alas , the sense of bloody good fun gets stretched too thin . there's not enough material here to sustain the running length , and the film goes through dead patches ( most of which occur when miller isn't on screen ) . all of the stuff with chris sarandon is a waste of time that should have been relegated to the cutting room floor -- except that would have trimmed bordello of blood to an unacceptably short sixty minutes or so . so , although this movie is an improvement over the dreadful demon knight ( then again , almost anything would be ) , it still hasn't convinced me that tales of the crypt belongs on the big screen . as for the film's commercial potential , i'm afraid it hasn't got much . at best , much like buffy , it will attain cult status . such is , after all , the deserved fate of movies like this .",

            "message": "fans of the * real * james bond exulted -- at least until they saw the movie . the only stipulation was that it had to be based on the characters and situations of the original thunderball . the result , which has a hokey , jokey feel , is possibly the worst-written bond script of all ( barring the satirical mess called casino royale ) . unfortunately , never say never again is a poor excuse for the veteran actor's return . the humor is over-the-top , the direction is pedestrian , and the storyline drags . were it not for the simple pleasure of seeing connery playing 007 one more time , this film would have been nearly unwatchable . all things considered , it's not a very good movie , but at least connery's charisma salvages parts of it . while the skeleton of never say never again resembles that of thunderball -- spectre steals two nuclear missiles and blackmails the world -- many of the details are different . in fact , those who haven't seen the 1965 film recently might not even recognize the connection . even bond has changed subtly -- given connery's age , he's better at delivering puns than punches . the hallmarks of every bond film are the big , often-absurd action sequences . never say never again can boast only one - - a wild car chase with bond on a q-designed motorbike -- and that's choreographed without flair . with the exception of a few isolated incidents here and there , like the silly fight that demolishes a health clinic , this film fails to generate much excitement . the acting is variable . brandauer is effective as largo and max von sydow may be the best blofeld of all . kim basinger is a singular embarrassment , not exhibiting the slightest wisp of acting talent . it's especially odd seeing someone other than desmond llewelyn tinkering with gadgets . there was a great deal of hype in 1983 about the \" dueling \" bonds -- roger moore's octopussy versus sean connery's never say never again . ultimately , both entries were duds , with never say never again offering slightly better entertainment based solely on connery's presence . nevertheless , it's a major disappointment that , having lured back the original 007 , the film makers couldn't offer him something better than this drawn-out , hackneyed story .",

            "message": "the first thing to note about waiting to exhale , forest whitaker's theatrical feature debut as a director , is that it will likely be a huge success with its target audience . many black women will see themselves in this motion picture , and , subconsciously using their personal background to fill in gaps left by the screenplay , they will declare this film a triumph . i wish i could be as positive with my opinion , but i found waiting to exhale to be seriously flawed -- a string of connected vignettes that propel the four main characters along easily predicted character arcs . of the quartet of stories , bernadine's is the most compelling . it's no coincidence that this character is played by angela bassett , the best actress in the cast . needless to say , bernadine doesn't react well to this news and her response -- torching his car with all his possessions in it -- will almost certainly garner loud cheers from women in the audience . although not as interesting as bernadine , loretta devine's gloria offers some worthwhile moments . waiting to exhale's other two characters -- savannah ( whitney houston ) and robin ( lela rochon ) -- are basically separate aspects of the same personality . neither of these stories is of more than passing interest , and the movie slows to a crawl when houston or rochon takes center stage . whitaker's direction , like the tone , is uneven . some of the switches from comedy to drama are forced and abrupt . that said , however , waiting to exhale contains a fair number of genuinely humorous sequences , many of which make pointed comments about male insensitivity . there are also several memorable serious scenes , the best of which team angela bassett with wesley snipes . not only does this pair sizzle , but the dialogue is intelligently-written and the performances are on- target . the most significant fault in waiting to exhale is its character presentation . with the exception of bernadine , i never felt anything for the women populating this film , as they failed to capture my interest or sympathy . part of this can be attributed to bland performances by houston and rochon , but the script must bear an equal share of the burden . no doubt about it -- this is a \" women's movie \" ( or , as it's alternatively referred to , a \" chick flick \" ) , but it's among the year's weakest . of all those films , however , this one has the most artificial and disjointed \" feel \" . personally , i don't buy the \" male bashing \" accusation that has been leveled at waiting to exhale . the treatment of men in the movie seems fine , and there are other problems more worthy of attention . given the dearth of significant roles for black women in motion pictures , it's refreshing to see these four bonding on the big screen -- and that's almost reason enough for this film to have been made . nevertheless , it's difficult to deny that another layer of substance is needed to lift the movie about this superficial level of melodrama .",

            "message": "undoubtedly impressed by the long-term , consistent profitability of paramount's star trek movies ( the ninth of which will be released this year ) , new line has decided to resurrect another late-'60s science fiction television enterprise , lost in space . star trek was a relatively serious , socially-conscious series while lost in space became infected with what i'll call the \" batman sickness , \" and , over the course of its four-year run , devolved from a semi-straight program into pure camp . much of that silliness has been removed for this big-budget , big-screen effort . fans of the original lost in space will likely not be displeased by the direction this movie takes . unfortunately , there's not much to supplement all the eye-popping visuals . the story is unfocused and the character development is virtually nonexistent . one of the problems is that lost in space uses more than 30 minutes setting up the plot , and it's not a particularly interesting half-hour . ( if a strong box office response warrants future installments , at least we will have gotten over this tedious hurdle . ) the set design in lost in space is impressive . the interior of the space ship is suitably futuristic-looking , while the earth-based scenes , with their visually-stunning backdrops , recall last year's the fifth element . most of the model sequences are equally flawless , but the computer-generated spider-like aliens have the same flaw exhibited by similar creatures in starship troopers ? they look fake . too bad some of the effects money wasn't spent on the script . lost in space is infected with a meandering storyline and lifeless protagonists . without a clear narrative drive , there doesn't seem to be much of a point to the whole endeavor . the desire to get home doesn't generate the level of urgency one might reasonably expect , and the movie ends up feeling like a few episodes of star trek : voyager strung together . there isn't a clear villain , either , since dr . smith is more of an anti-hero than anything else ? his motivation is self-interest , not malice . smith becomes a fascinating blend of charisma and delicious nastiness . beyond oldman , however , the cast is disappointingly bland . heather graham , who was wonderful as rollergirl in boogie nights , fails to do anything interesting with judy . chabert especially shows spunk , but she has the least screen time of the major players . incidentally , it could be argued that it wouldn't have mattered if everyone in the cast had been in peak acting form , since the script delivers the kind of two-dimensional characters involved in shallow relationships that even top-notch performances couldn't do much with . lost in space features a few action sequences that generate adrenaline jolts , but this is not an edge-of-the-seat motion picture . this may add to the film's attraction in some quarters , but not as far as i'm concerned . i wanted a little more energy and a story that went somewhere . as a result , while i can offer a mild endorsement of lost in space as a comic book come to life , it's too weak a film for me to stamp with an unqualified recommendation . \" my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . \" -- david puttnam",

            "message": "i guess there are some concepts that don't excel in the translation from the small screen to the big one , and mystery science theater 3000 appears to be among these . the tv series , which started on a minneapolis uhf channel in 1988 before moving to hbo's comedy channel in 1989 , provides light , undemanding entertainment for those who enjoy lampooning ( or , perhaps more appropriately , harpooning ) bad movies . this new motion picture incarnation , which boasts larger sets but essentially the same format , is on par with one of the lesser episodes . as a tv diversion , mst3k is thoroughly enjoyable , but , in this new medium , it's something of a disappointment . for those unfamiliar with the mst3k premise , it goes something like this : a dastardly mad scientist , dr . forrester ( trace beaulieu ) , has decided to conquer the world by subjecting the entire population to bad movies . instead of being tortured into submission , however , these three actually seem to enjoy the experience . episode-after-episode , they sit in the audience and mock whatever \" cinematic suppository \" forrester exhibits . as viewers , we see a movie screen showing the picture of choice with a row of seats and three moving heads silhouetted against it . for mst3k : the movie , the film-to-be-savaged is this island earth , a 1954 science fiction embarrassment that could hold its own against any other entries in the worst movie of all time competition . a significant problem with using a movie this deliciously bad is that the film generates enough unintentional humor on its own , so it doesn't really need the quips and barbs from servo , mike , and crow . although a number of their comments are very funny , this island earth would have had me doubled over with laughter had i seen it without the mst3k format . unfortunately , during the course of this film , there are several contrived breaks that get the characters out of the darkened theater . during these sequences , without a cheesy flick to inspire them , their banter comes across as juvenile . such unnecessary and pointless padding dilutes the movie's better aspects . die-hard fans will undoubtedly be delighted , but it's more difficult to determine how casual viewers will react , especially if they realize that they're paying for something that's no better than what's available on tv . in fact , the theatrical environment may stifle mst3k , unless you happen to see it in a rocky horror picture show setting . by its nature , mst3k demands audience participation -- something difficult to obtain in a typical movie-watching environment . in general , it's easy to praise the ingenuity of the mst3k writers , although less for this script than for some of what they have previously accomplished . in this case , however , mst3k : the movie is routine -- sporadically funny , occasionally clever , but routine nonetheless .",

            "message": "cast : jim carrey , maura tierney , justin cooper , jennifer tilley , cary elwes , amanda donohoe , swoosie kurtz director : tom shadyac producers : brian grazer screenplay : paul guay & stephen mazur cinematography : russell boyd music : john debney and james newton howard u . s . distributor : universal pictures while watching liar liar , it occurred to me that the chief problem with this film is that it has a script . if jim carrey had been unleashed without such silly , incidental constraints as plot and dialogue , who knows where things might have gone ? as it is , however , carrey is forced to confine his antics to the needs of liar liar's unimaginative screenplay , and the results are mixed . there are times when carrey is excruciatingly funny , but , on those occasions when he's expected to do anything remotely approaching \" real \" acting , his limitations become abundantly clear . liar liar is the latest in a long line of movies to skewer lawyers . in this case , the assumption is that it's impossible for an attorney to get through the day without resorting to all sorts of lies and half- truths . for a nation that has just endured more than a year's worth of o . j . simpson-related testimony , this idea has a great deal of resonance . so , although a smartly-written satire about this subject could be immensely satisfying , that film is * not * liar liar . as directed by physical comedy specialist tom shadyac ( ace ventura : pet detective , the nutty professor ) , this outing is designed for one purpose only -- as a showcase for jim carrey . the potential richness of the premise is irrelevant . carrey plays ( and i use that word loosely ) fletcher reede , a slick- talking lawyer whose over-the-top court performances have earned him numerous unexpected victories . several of the court scenes are equally funny , with carrey investing so much zany energy that it's almost impossible not to laugh . there's no denying that the actor is a gifted physical comic , and his fans will almost certainly be pleased by what he has accomplished here . unfortunately , there is a dramatic element to this story , and that's where carrey stumbles . that aspect of the film doesn't really work , however , because carrey's lack of range has us snickering almost as much at his attempts to be serious as at his most outrageous comic moments . all-in-all , liar liar is pretty good fun , and it represents one of carrey's most entertaining movies to date . ( could he -- gasp -- be growing on me ? ) the comic is in top form , both in the material that made it into the picture and during the end-credit outtakes ( which , in many ways , are funnier ) . and it's delightful to watch performers like amanda donohoe and helium-voiced jennifer tilley struggle to keep their composure when carrey does something exceptionally goofy . in the past , i have said that i generally prefer jim carrey in small doses . this may be the exception . without him , liar liar would have been an unforgivably bad movie . with him , it's a mediocre film peppered with amusing highlights . and , honestly , i think that just about says all that needs to be said about gentleman jim's followup to the cable guy .",

            "message": "the scrutiny surrounding tomorrow never dies , the eighteenth \" official \" james bond film ( not counting casino royale or never say never again ) , isn't as intense as it was around goldeneye , but the attendant hype is , if anything , even more severe . product tie-ins are everywhere . turn on the tv , and you'll see pierce brosnan's bond hocking cars and credit cards . now , with tomorrow never dies , it's back to business as usual -- continuing the once-again healthy franchise . tomorrow never dies is a better film than goldeneye . in fact , it's the best bond film in many years . for the first time since the legendary sean connery left the part , this movie feels like a connery bond adventure . pierce brosnan , having left behind the jitters he occasionally exhibited during goldeneye , now inhabits his character with a suave confidence that is very like connery's . the villain of the piece , elliot carver ( played with panache by jonathan pryce ) , is cut from the blofeld/goldfinger mold -- sinister , cunning , and charismatic . ( how many of the roger moore/timothy dalton bad guys fit this type ? ) as is usually the case in a 007 flick , the bad guy is a megalomaniac . and that's where bond comes in . equipped with a brand new bmw that can almost drive itself , 007 goes undercover into carver's empire , pretending to be a banker . brosnan and yeoh click , and if there was ever a bond girl worth considering for an encore , wai lin is it . i can't be as positive regarding teri hatcher , who turns the supposedly-exotic paris into a bland , unalluring figure . her shared past with 007 is supposed to bring out his vulnerable side ( last seen at the end of on her majesty's secret service ) , but it's hard to believe that such an uninteresting person could inspire any kind of emotion . hatcher is the film's most obvious weak link -- fortunately , her screen time is limited . the action sequences are suitably entertaining . it's impossible to count the number of bullets fired , and there are pyrotechnics aplenty , including exploding missiles , a fireworks show on the ground , and a fairly spectacular climactic conflagration . for those who crave flashes , bangs , narrow escapes , and other action film staples , tomorrow never dies delivers . while the script isn't as openly jokey as some of the roger moore screenplays , it contains a fair number of one-liners . while some of these are predictable , several of them are unforgettably witty . brown's judi dench ) makes an acid comment about the roles of men and women in the politics of war , and moneypenney ( samantha bond ) offers a pun about bond's canny knowledge of different languages ( surely the best line of the film ) . there's also some playful repartee between 007 and his chinese counterpart . bond fans will likely love this movie . detractors will yawn it away as \" more of the same . \" in a way , however , that's the point . no one really wants bond to change or evolve , at least not significantly . tomorrow never dies isn't fundamentally much different from goldeneye or goldfinger , for that matter . it's the same basic formula put to effective use . what separates a good bond movie from a bad one isn't the plot -- it's the supporting cast , the intangibles , and the energy level . following this effort , there's no doubt that , once again , james bond will return . - ingmar bergman",

            "message": "dangerous beauty is a lavish historical melodrama that has enough suds , sex , and flashes of flesh to appeal to soap opera-lovers and enough substance to attract those of a more intellectual bent . however , while the movie does more than pay lip service to themes of female empowerment and religious intolerance , the main focus is the kind of hopeless , star-crossed romance that gave wings of the dove flight . that appellation was dropped for fear that audiences wouldn't know what it meant . however , not only is the honest courtesan a more apt title , but it's a more provocative one . the words \" dangerous beauty \" mean very little , especially in connection with this film . in fact , a name like this sounds more apropos for a soft-core exploitation flick than a sumptuous tale of late-16th century venice . the time of dangerous beauty is the era in which shakespeare lived and thrived , and the region of the world in which this story transpires was one of the bard's favorite locales . as in many of shakespeare's plays , the film makers have elected to have english-speaking actors play italian characters . what's more , there are no silly accents . and , although the dialogue sounds more contemporary than archaic , the costumes , set design , and attitudes of the characters serve as powerful reminders that this is an historical tale . marriage had nothing to do with love -- it was a contract made based exclusively on considerations of wealth and position . the actress has a wonderfully expressive face and is capable of flowing effortlessly from an almost-comic portrayal to a more serious one . one of dangerous beauty's subtle treasures is the top-notch supporting cast . the actors , like the story , are helped immeasurably by the film's look . visually , this is a gorgeous motion picture . cinematographer bojan bazelli's camera loves the streets and canals of venice , making the city as much a character as any of the people . filters only enhance the beauty . using bazelli's photography as a catalyst , herskovitz creates the perfect tone -- one that is often serious , but occasionally playful , and where serenity can be suddenly interrupted by a burst of passion . as is the case with too many melodramas designed to give the audience a triumphant rush , dangerous beauty goes over the top in its closing moments , offering speech-making and grandstanding that undercuts some of the film's drama . still , it's hard to argue that , contrived as it may be , there's something satisfying about the way things wrap up . a \" commercial \" finale isn't the worst thing that could happen in a picture like this -- it may be emotionally manipulative , but , on a certain level , it works . dangerous beauty isn't great art , but it is good entertainment . - ingmar bergman",

            "message": "as written by victor hugo , the 19th century classic novel les miserables is a long , sprawling epic that encompasses everything from the political upheaval of post-revolutionary france to the intimate orchestrations of the heart . over the years , millions of fans have come to admire jean valjean , the book's protagonist , who proves that a man can change , and to adore cosette , the one girl who captures his heart . considering the book's length , which easily exceeds 1000 pages ( it is probably the second-longest novel i have ever read ) , there's no way that a 135-minute motion picture can begin to capture its vast scope ( nor , for that matter , can a 3-plus hour popular musical ) . nevertheless , while screenwriter's rafael yglesias makes a host of significant cuts , he manages not only to capture the essence of les miserables' key theme -- redemption -- but also to faithfully render the characters as more than one-dimensional condensations of their literary inspirations . as brought to the screen by neeson , valjean is not only a grand , heroic figure , but a distinctly human individual as well , with frailties aplenty . geoffrey rush , as dislikable here as he was likable as david helfgott in shine , makes javert a memorable villain , but he avoids the obvious temptation of turning the inspector into a cartoonish bad guy . as valjean has his failings , so javert has his virtues , and there are many times when we pity him more than hate him . it's an obsession that blinds javert to all else , and consumes his entire life . none of the supporting actors come close to matching neeson's quiet intensity or rush's zeal . uma thurman is surprisingly effective as fantine , but she's on-screen for less than a quarter of the film . given to overacting her most emotionally-charged scenes , danes seems wrong for the part . hans matheson , playing her love interest , is rather bland , but he is handicapped by an underwritten part . the marius of the movie is a pale shadow of the marius of the book , and the screen version of the love story is far from captivating . marius often seems more like a plot device than a genuine character . directed by bille august , who was once hand-picked by ingmar bergman to helm the best intentions , les miserables is a gloriously rich , if flawed , drama . the two-plus hours fly by as we are captivated by the characters and their circumstances . despite being condensed from a novel that would take 20 hours to present in its entirety , the film rarely has the feel of being rushed . it progresses briskly , but in such a manner that we never lose sight of the two-pronged emotional core of the story : valjean's rivalry with javert and his deep , abiding love for cosette . this is not , of course , the first motion picture version of les miserables , but it is one of the better ones , with a streamlined script that doesn't have the uneven feel of many of its predecessors . there's little doubt that the popularity of the musical made it easier to finance the movie , but anyone expecting singing and dancing will be in for a shock . and , while this version of les miserables lacks the cleverness and contemporary spin evident in claude lelouch's brilliant 1995 re-interpretation , it is moving and effective in its own right , as a more \" straightforward \" adaptation . kudos to all involved for a finely-crafted period drama that delivers over two hours of solid , literate entertainment . \" my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . \" -- david puttnam",

            "message": "let me say up front that i have never been especially fond of canadian geese . now that i've made that admission , you might be surprised to learn that i actually liked the goose-fest , fly away home . fly away home starts with one of the most disconcerting scenes i've seen in a recent motion picture : a silent car accident that takes place during the opening credits while a soft , gentle melody plays in the background . the effect created by this juxtaposition of tragic and hopeful elements is sufficient to arrest anyone's attention . and , while the film never again attains this level of artistry , there are a few scenes that come close . caleb deschanel's photography is one of the movie's highlights . her response to that : \" that's a lame excuse , dad . \" and , of course , it is . as a family film , fly away home has something for members of every temperament and age group : adventure , pathos , technical detail about the design of the aircraft , cute animals , and human drama . there's also a pro-conservation message that , while laudable in intent , comes across as simplistic and heavy-handed ( land developers = bad ; geese = good ) . when she's quiet and reflective , paquin is excellent ; but there are too many instances when she goes overboard . while daniels has something to do , delany is pretty much relegated to the background , although , in the wake of exit to eden and live nude girls , it's a little odd to see her in such a \" tame \" role . director carroll ballard , who brought 1979's the black stallion to the screen , has long since proven his ability to produce solid family fare . ballard uses this as the backdrop for a warm drama that's more about love and trust between a father and daughter than inter-species connections . the result , even for geese-haters , is charming .",

            "message": "it's understandable if you think you've seen this story before , because , if you're any kind of regular movie-goer , you undoubtedly have . perhaps one reason why this is such a popular premise is that it's such a frequent real-life occurrence . and , as long as there's something new or interesting in the experience , it's hard to argue with exploring these themes . sweet nothing doesn't boast an outstanding script or innovative direction , but it has a pair of exceptionally strong performances , and that's enough to earn it a recommendation . the storyline and directorial style are both relatively straightforward -- there are none of the flourishes associated with trainspotting . sweet nothing doesn't break any new ground , but , like all well-made , drug- related films , it does cause us to consider the incredible power and reach of any controlled substance . many \" drug movies \" are so dark and cynical that it's difficult , if not impossible , to care about the main characters . not so here . even the possibility of addiction doesn't worry angel -- he falls into the common trap of believing that he can stop just as easily as he started . imperioli makes us see angel as a good man with a tragic flaw , and , up to the very end , we're in sympathy with him . oscar-winner mira sorvino , who made this movie before mighty aphrodite , plays monika with the same earnestness and vulnerability that she displayed in whit stillman's barcelona . sweet nothing isn't going to score any points with the drug using community , even though it's more of a character study than a \" message \" movie . there's certainly no preaching , although the scenes of angel scheming , dealing , and stealing to get money for his next hit don't paint an appealing picture . ultimately , sweet nothing is simply the latest movie to explore the pervasive and destructive impact of drug use and drug-related crime on american society .",

            "message": "smilla's sense of snow ( say it three times fast and sound like an asp ) opens with a breathtaking image : great cliffs of gray-blue ice towering over a vast plain of white . and , while this sequence seems completely disconnected with the movie that follows , it is a visually pleasing way to introduce a contemporary mystery that incorporates murder , greed , and science fiction into an often uneven , occasionally preposterous , but always engrossing whole . although the action transpires entirely in copenhagen and greenland , the dialogue is exclusively in english , with nary a subtitle to be found . as thrillers go , smilla's sense of snow is definitely unconventional . the storyline is reasonably complex ( not to mention a little silly ) and features enough small surprises and twists to retain the average viewer's attention . and , the fact that it's a \" why-dunnit \" or \" how-dunnit , \" rather than a \" who-dunnit , \" allows us to focus on more interesting issues than identifying possible red herrings . as crisply directed by bille august ( pelle the conqueror ) , smilla's sense of snow moves rapidly -- almost too rapidly . the plot clicks along so briskly that numerous character details get lost in the rush . smilla , as forcefully portrayed by ormond , is a fascinating character , but many of the more interesting aspects of her personality are relegated to the background . in fact , there were times when i actually became annoyed at the film for pursuing the plot with single-minded determination rather than taking a few moments to delve more deeply into the main character . smilla is presented with enough detail to tantalize , but not enough to satisfy . in the end , we're left wishing the movie had spent a little more time filling in a few more blanks . aside from ormond , whose turn as smilla is both effective and attention-grabbing , and richard harris , who brings a world-weary cynicism to his part , the acting is surprisingly lackluster . he's supposed to be enigmatic , but the actor's one-note performance makes him lifeless . the film's climax will probably seem preposterous for anyone expecting smilla's sense of snow to stay grounded in reality . if nothing else , the opening sequence should prepare you to accept that boundaries not normally crossed in murder mysteries will be broken . smilla's sense of snow is not a landmark thriller , nor is it likely to appeal to those who demand a semblance of reality . but it is involving and entertaining , and features an intriguing , independent heroine . those things alone make it worth a trip to a nearby theater .",

            "message": "the previews for muriel's wedding liken this latest australian import to two of its predecessors , strictly ballroom and the adventures of priscilla , queen of the desert . these are inaccurate , not to mention misleading , comparisons . those expecting something light and airy from this tragic-comedy are in for an unpleasant surprise , for , while muriel's wedding has its moments of exhilarating humor , it is , as often as not , downbeat and even mean-spirited . perhaps the best recent antecedent to muriel's wedding is proof . both films are from house/moorhouse productions ( writer/director p . j . hogan is married to co-producer jocelyn moorhouse ) , and , while this film lacks proof's seamless marriage of comedy and drama , there are distinct similarities in tone and pacing . muriel's wedding could easily be viewed as a social commentary thinly disguised as something a little less pretentious . certainly , one is more likely to emerge from this motion picture with a less upbeat attitude than the one resulting from ballroom or priscilla . one of the most pleasant aspects of muriel's wedding is the distinctly unconventional third act . no one seeing this movie will confuse it with a hollywood picture , as it continually flouts the \" feel good \" formulas that typically characterize this sort of romantic comedy . the ending is far-from-perfect , but it's a great deal better than several obvious alternatives . nevertheless , parts of muriel's wedding are heavy-handed and , as a result , needlessly uncomfortable to view . there are times when hogan almost seems to enjoy belittling and degrading muriel . while it's necessary to understand her low self-image , the director goes to excessive , almost-sadistic , lengths to get his point across . on these occasions , the film becomes a little difficult to endure . balancing these moments are some high-energy scenes , including a wonderful lip-synch of abba's \" waterloo \" by muriel and rachel , muriel trying on wedding dresses to the tune of \" dancing queen \" , and an almost- sex scene featuring sofa cushions being unzipped instead of skirts . the soundtrack , featuring at least five abba songs , is effectively energetic , and includes a peter best-arranged instrumental version of \" dancing queen \" performed by a full orchestra . those who rely on miramax's ads to prepare them for muriel's wedding may be disappointed , but that's not the film's fault . muriel's wedding isn't a perfect comedy , tragedy , or drama , but it contains enough original elements of each to make it worth a look . ultimately , however , individual enjoyment of this picture may be in direct proportion to a viewer's ability to tolerate abba's omnipresent music .",

            "message": "any traditional version of shakespeare's \" richard iii \" will open with \" now's the winter of our discontent made summer by this son of york \" , the first line of one of the bard's best-known soliloquies . this movie , a labor of love for al pacino , who makes his directorial debut , does not intend to present a complete , unabridged version of the text . looking for richard is a condensed version of \" richard iii \" wrapped in a stream-of-consciousness documentary . i don't think it's a serious concern , however . the primary audience will be shakespeare buffs , and , even if they have seen mckellan's adaptation , they won't mind . besides , the films , despite telling essentially the same story , have vastly different approaches . richard iii translates the play to a 20th century , pseudo- nazi england while looking for richard keeps the original historical context intact but adds a great deal of work-in-progress footage . pacino begins the film as a documentary investigating what modern day audiences think of shakespeare's works . the answers he gets during person-on-the-street interviews are predictable : \" it sucks \" , \" it's boring \" , \" huh ? \" the director's motivation for making the movie is stated up front : \" it has always been a dream of mine to communicate how i feel about shakespeare to others . \" to do this , pacino interviews numerous actors and scholars . we glimpse the casting process and are given an impromptu history lesson about the war of the roses ( which functions as background material ) . someone in the crew worries that no one knows \" richard iii \" , but the assertion is made that it's the most often-performed of all of the bard's plays . and , although the documentary portion of looking for richard is largely over at this point , occasional interludes throughout the remainder of the film return to this format . the second half of looking for richard concentrates on performing select scenes from the play . although perhaps only a third of the full text is used , even someone who has never seen \" richard iii \" should have no problem following what's happening ( pacino's narrative interruptions attempt to explain potentially-confusing issues ) . the unconventional method of filming , which becomes a little wearisome through repetitiveness , must have required extensive time in the editing room . there are lots of quick shots that switch between a full , costumed version of a play and a simple read-through . at times , looking for richard recalls vanya on 42nd street , although this movie makes the behind-the-scenes sequences a more important part of the whole . a number of familiar faces fill roles here . it's worth noting that , while the play sequences appear to have been produced over a relatively short period of time , the entire film has taken years to piece together , as is evident from pacino's constantly changing appearance ( short hair and a beard in one scene , clean-shaven with long , flowing locks in the next ) . although pacino is attempting to make \" richard iii \" accessible to the \" average \" movie-goer , he probably doesn't succeed . looking for richard is a fascinating piece of film making , but i don't think it does anything so revolutionary that non-believers will be suddenly converted . pacino's passion is obvious , but it's not universally contagious . however , those who enjoy shakespeare , or are at least open-minded , will find much to appreciate here . looking for richard is unlike any previous adaptation of the bard's work , and that's reason enough to give it a shot . -- ingmar bergman",

            "message": "oliver stone is perhaps best known for his numerous politically- influenced motion pictures -- everything from his vietnam trilogy to jfk and nixon . now , with his latest audacious outing , stone has set his sights on a genre film . the result , called u- turn , is film noir steeped in excess . yet , although stone has clearly made this motion picture with his tongue planted firmly in his cheek , he nevertheless manages to capture all of the tension and mystery necessary to hold the viewer's interest . hence , while stone may be poking a little good-natured fun at the genre , he has also created a highly- successful entry to it . but , although much was different about the way the movie was put together , it still bears many hallmarks of recent stone productions . the excesses of the photographic style hearken back to natural born killers and include black & white inserts , numerous hand-held shots , overexposed sequences , hallucinogenic effects , and time-lapses . i'm not a big fan of this sort of camera trickery , since it seems designed more to show off a director's pretentiousness than to add anything significant to the motion picture . this approach helped sink natural born killers ; fortunately , it's only occasionally distracting here . the narrative twists and turns in a serpentine fashion , rarely proceeding in a predictable or straightforward manner for more than a few minutes at a time ( hence , the title ) . film noir aficionados will recognize and/or expect many of the plot's contortions , since there are various requirements that have to be met by any entry of the genre . however , anticipating certain occurrences doesn't necessarily diminish our enjoyment , and the film takes so many detours that at least one or two of them are bound to surprise even the most jaded movie-goer . film noir is always more plot-conscious than character-focused , and this is pretty much the case here . stone and writer john ridley have populated u-turn with a variety of colorful types , only a few of whom show the beginnings of multi-dimensionality . the best-developed individual is , not surprisingly , the lead . the denizens of superior are a strange lot . penn , one of his generation's best actors , makes bobby into more than just a moody loner . meanwhile , the sultry lopez plays up the ambiguities of her character , so we're never quite sure whether she's a good girl , a bad girl , or something in between . many viewers will recognize echoes of red rock west in u-turn . but , as fun and frantic as red rock west was , u-turn tops it , adding 30 minutes of running time and doubling the number of plot twists . plus , stone's lurid , graphic , in-your-face style is far different from john dahl's homage to '40s and '50s movies . u-turn is definitely not for everyone -- some viewers will find the juxtaposition of offbeat comedy and noir cliches too strange and others will be offended by the film's extreme violence . nevertheless , for those who enjoy movies on the edge , u-turn offers just the trajectory you might expect . \" the cinema is not an art which films life : the cinema is something between art and life . unlike painting and literature , the cinema both gives to life and takes from it . . . \" - jean-luc godard",

            "message": "taylor hackford's the devil's advocate has many laudable qualities , but subtlety is not among them . and , in what is arguably the most believable aspect of the movie , the devil's advocate takes lawyer-bashing to its logical extreme by making lucifer the head of a prestigious law firm . see what i mean -- no subtlety . that being said , the devil's advocate is a highly-enjoyable motion picture that's part character study , part supernatural thriller , and part morality play . although the film isn't a landmark combination of unique elements ( viewers will find themselves reminded of both the witches of eastwick and the firm ) , it has a lot of energy and the rather long 145-minute running time passes quickly . co-writer tony gilroy ( the cutting edge , dolores claiborne ) , who was brought in by director hackford ( dolores claiborne ) to expand upon jonathan lemkin's original adaptation of andrew niederman's novel , has produced a script that transcends any one specific genre , criss-crossing back and forth from horror to satire to melodrama . kevin's approach to a trial isn't that it's a forum for justice , but a game to be won or lost -- and he is willing to do anything for victory , even if he knows that his client is guilty ( the official term for this kind of person is a \" sleazeball \" ) . of course , this is the kind of over-the-top role that pacino plays best , and his virtuoso performance comes complete with a pair of the kind of monologues that he does better than anyone else working in hollywood today . of all the recent approaches to this role , pacino's dracula-esque method stands alongside the work of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) as the most memorable . although the spotlight shines squarely on pacino , there are other actors in the film . and , while pacino's performance is the best , it's not the most surprising . there are times when reeves lacks the subtlety that would have made this a more multi-layered portrayal , but it's nevertheless a solid job . spicy chalize theron ( trial and error ) is fine as mary ann , bringing equal parts sex appeal and pathos to a surprisingly well-developed role . aside from pacino's performance , the greatest strength of the film is its delicious build-up to an operatic climax . and , although huge parts of the devil's advocate are overblown and overplayed , it's never as silly as it has the potential to be -- and this quality consistently keeps the picture out of the dangerous realm of self-parody . the movie's greatest weakness is its ending , which , by trying to be too clever , ends up cheating the audience of a legitimate conclusion . while there's a sense of closure , it's not an especially satisfying one . oddly enough , with two of the most high-profile horror films of the year ( scream 2 and an american werewolf in paris ) slated for a december release , the devil's advocate may be the best option for a \" halloween flick , \" and the pairing of pacino and reeves should assure it a healthy bow at the box office . it doesn't hurt that the script is more intelligent that one might initially suppose and that the storyline is developed better than the theatrical previews cause it to appear to be . the devil's advocate certainly has problems , chief of which is the subtlety thing , but pacino's performance is so fun to watch that it eclipses the most significant of them . \" for me , the cinema is not a slice of life , but a piece of cake . \"",

            "message": "praise for the indian director , who died in 1992 shortly after receiving a lifetime achievement oscar , has been effusive from both film makers and critics . and james ivory , the director of howards end and the remains of the day , has said that , after watching a ray movie , the viewer will feel \" fulfilled , enriched , maybe wiser , and wanting more . \" indeed , it is ivory , along with his partner , ismail merchant , who has made this screening of pather panchali , ray's directorial debut , possible . the movies , which exist on video but are not readily available , are worth searching out . anyone who believes in the uplifting power of motion pictures will not be disappointed . ray takes the time to create a meticulously believable world that draws the viewer in . there isn't a false note in the entire film -- not in the characterization , the dialogue , or the storyline . the emotions evoked by the events of pather panchali are honest and true , not the contrived byproducts of manipulative formulas . ray makes us feel with the characters , not just for them . most of what transpires is shown through the eyes of either sarbojaya or durga , and , as a result , we identify most closely with these two . harihar is absent for more than half of the movie , and , before the penultimate scene , abu is a mere witness to events , rather than a participant . until the closing moments , we don't get a sense of the young boy as a fully formed individual , since he's always in someone else's shadow . with its often-poetic black-and-white images and heartfelt method of storytelling , pather panchali speaks intimately to each member of the audience . this tale , as crafted by ray , touches the souls and minds of viewers , transcending cultural and linguistic barriers . the languorous pace , which initially seems detrimental , proves to be an asset -- pather panchali would not have been the same experience had material been cut . this is the kind of motion picture that will stay with you for hours , or perhaps even days , after you've left the theater , and that's a rare characteristic for any movie .",

            "message": "new zealand , 1995 u . s . release date : not known running length : 0 : 52 mpaa classification : no mpaa rating ( mature themes , brief nudity ) theatrical aspect ratio : 1 . 85 : 1 shown at the philadelphia festival of world cinema , 5/6/97 & 5/9/97 with some \" mockumentaries \" ( or \" meta-documentaries \" , \" pseudo- documentaries \" , or whatever else you want to call them ) , it's best not to know beforehand that they're fakes . with this film , if you don't know in advance that it isn't a real documentary , you'll almost certainly be bamboozled , and , in the process , miss some of the most subtle humor . taken at face value , forgotten silver is mildly entertaining , but , for those who recognize its true nature , it's nothing short of brilliant . jeffrey thomas , a man with an appropriately stentorian voice , does the narration for forgotten silver , which is presented as a straightforward documentary about an all-but-forgotten , turn-of-the- century new zealand film maker . his achievements included inventing the first mechanized camera , making the first full-length feature film with sound ( in 1908 -- it was a failure because all of the actors spoke chinese and he didn't have the foresight to invent subtitles ) , experimenting with color ( in 1911 -- he was arrested on smut charges because a topless woman appeared in the test film ) , and introducing the closeup . movie critic/historian leonard maltin gushes about the scope and quality of mckenzie's work . actor sam neill comments about the importance of the mckenzie revelations to the new zealand film industry . using subtle special effects to re-create old , damaged footage , forgotten silver makes it easy to believe that we're seeing celluloid that has been stored in a shed for fifty years . not only are we treated to glimpses of mckenzie's pioneering efforts in cinema , but we're shown significant chunks of salome , a credible-looking silent presentation of the biblical tale about the dancing girl who demanded john the baptist's head . while the film makers have crafted forgotten silver as a first- rate parody , it's clear that both men possess a great deal of affection for and knowledge about the early history of cinema . this is the sort of project one might expect from peter jackson , the inventive director whose previous outings have included the brilliant heavenly creatures , the outrageously sick meet the feebles , and the big-budget , offbeat comedy , the frighteners . along with co- director costa botes , jackson has put together one of the most interesting fake documentaries to come along since the genre was first popularized with this is spinal tap . the more you love film and understand film history , the more you'll get out of this picture , but even the most oblivious movie-goers will find forgotten silver's mixture of fact and fiction enjoyable . when this movie was shown on new zealand tv , it's impact was akin to that of orson welles' legendary halloween radio broadcast of war of the worlds . this simple fact shouldn't be taken as an indication of new zealanders' gullibility , but of the effectiveness of forgotten silver . watch it carefully , and you'll be amused , amazed , and entertained .",

            "message": "angela pope's hollow reed is one of the most striking , forceful films to emerge onto the american art house scene so far this year , but , like many powerful motion pictures , it can be extremely difficult to watch . and , while the beatings aren't as graphic or brutal as those in another recent domestic violence motion picture , once were warriors , they're all the more wrenching because , in this case , the victim is a ten year old boy . yet , if hollow reed's sole subject matter had been child abuse , it wouldn't have been as provocative or challenging . equality is a word that everyone loves to speak , but , in today's world , there are times when it remains a distant fantasy . part of the reason that hollow reed is so punishing is that it's told from a child's point-of-view . relating the story from oliver's perspective allows us to better understand the fear , confusion , and self-blame that the child experiences . physical damage isn't the only byproduct of abuse ; it has deep-reaching psychological ramifications as well , the effects of which can be far more lasting . oliver's reasons for not telling are complex , and hollow reed makes his silence on the subject seem completely rational under the circumstances . understandably , he doesn't like frank , but , while the movie casts him in the role of the villain , it manages to humanize him to a degree , offering a motivation for his actions . his impotence ratchets up the level of tension that pope works so hard to create . hollow reed isn't meant to be a thriller , but the tone is darker and more ominous than is typical for a drama . the key to donovan's performance is that it starts out low-key . however , all of the adults , including richardson , donovan , and the fine supporting cast , are outacted by young sam bould , who captures the essence of oliver without a hint of the confusion and awkwardness that sometimes marks child performances . bould has many memorable moments -- hiding under a work bench so that frank won't find him , preparing to defend himself with a chisel , and bravely enduring the punishment that frank dishes out . in life , there are no easy answers , and hollow reed is nothing if not an accurate mirror of reality . this is not the sort of motion picture that's likely to find favor with the \" feel good \" crowd , but , if you aren't afraid of a movie that is capable of challenging convictions and wrenching emotions , hollow reed makes for an unforgettable two hours .",

            "message": "but , unlike films that live or die on the basis of unexpected plot disclosures , secrets are only important to the locusts in the way they define the characters , explain their motivations , and drive their actions . it's entirely possible to guess one ( or more ) of the truths that these men and women keep buried before those revelations are explicitly divulged , but such insight is unlikely to diminish your appreciation of this film in any significant way . in fact , it may actually enhance it . the locusts is a genuinely powerful motion picture that achieves its potency through character development rather than audience manipulation . this approach is becoming increasingly rare in dramatic motion pictures , which often try too hard to generate tears , and it speaks highly of first time feature director john patrick kelly's ability to tell a story . the locusts is also successful in the way it manages to interweave small moments of triumph with intimate tragedies . this is not by any means a \" feel good \" motion picture ( quite the opposite , in fact ) , but there are times when it touches a core of optimism . writer/director kelly has chosen a strong cast to work with . vince vaughn , who made his mark in swingers before appearing in the lost world , gives his strongest performance to date -- an intelligent and believable rendering of a man trapped by powerful emotional forces . kate capshaw , best known as either mrs . steven spielberg or \" the girl from the second indiana jones movie \" , renders mrs . potts with the intensity and style of a femme fatale -- sexy , mysterious , and dangerous . the most striking performance , however , belongs to jeremy davies ( spanking the monkey ) , whose interpretation of flyboy is worthy of mention alongside that of dustin hoffman from rain man , tom hanks from forrest gump , billy bob thornton from sling blade , and geoffrey rush from shine . the locusts is as rich in themes as it is in three-dimensional characters . there's atonement , redemption , revenge , and a particularly brutal examination of the shifting balance of power between men and women , and parents and children . but the one with the darkest motivation is mrs . potts , who makes no excuse for her savagery and the manner in which she abuses every kind of power at her disposal . the narrative for the locusts does justice to each of these motifs as it gradually peels back the onion-like layers of the characters to reveal the complexity that lies beneath . the film doesn't offer any simpleminded solutions to difficult issues , and there are two very different ways to interpret the ending ( depending on whether you're an optimist or a pessimist ) . the locusts explores both extremes of the human experience -- the purity of innocence and the viciousness of cruelty -- as well as many of the ambiguous shades in between . if there's one misstep in the locusts , it's that the meaning of the title ( which is a metaphor ) is explained a little too obviously . but that's an extremely minor quibble and it does little to detract from the strength of this film , which is one of the year's best . \" the cinema is not an art which films life : the cinema is something between art and life . unlike painting and literature , the cinema both gives to life and takes from it . . . \" - jean-luc godard",

' \" indeed , it is the importance of music to camille that puts every other emotion in the film , whether displayed by her or by others , into perspective . un coeur en hiver is yet another case of real-life chemistry translating well to the screen . beart and auteuil are companions away from their acting , and the spark of this intensity , even unfulfilled as it is here , is too obvious to miss . with the exceptions of much ado about nothing and sommersby , there have been no 1993 releases to equal the power of un coeur en hiver . strong characters , intelligent writing , and exquisite performances combine to draw the audience into the movie . mental and emotional participation are demanded . this is a movie with deep , churning currents . those who are attracted only to hollywood's shallow waters may find un coeur en hiver too intimidating , but anyone who enjoys a more complex cinematic experience will find as much as they could hope for in this picture .",

            "message": "united states , 1997 ( original 1980 ) release date : 5/21/80 ( wide ) special edition release date : 2/21/97 ( wide ) running length ( special edition ) : 2 : 06 mpaa classification : pg ( mild violence ) theatrical aspect ratio : 2 . 35 : 1 indulge me for a moment as i time travel back to 1980 . but , for science fiction movie lovers , there was only one event : the may 21 opening of the empire strikes back . the movie was a guaranteed success before its first public show . although it lacks the pioneering \" newness \" of star wars , the empire strikes back is in many ways a superior motion picture . the storyline is more interesting and ambitious , the characters -- little more than appealing types in the original -- are allowed to grow and develop , the special effects are more mature , and the tone is deliciously dark and downbeat . it's the latter quality that has made the empire strikes back the least favorite among young star wars fans -- excepting yoda , there's nothing cute to be found , and the film definitely doesn't leave viewers with a warm , fuzzy feeling . in the first film , good triumphed decisively over evil ; here , it's almost the other way around . for the special edition , lucas has chosen to do considerably less re-engineering than he did with star wars , which is evidence that empire , as originally presented , was close to his vision . the soundtrack has been digitally beefed up , a few new scenes have been inserted ( including some extended shots of the wampa ice creature's attack ) , and certain effects sequences have been noticably enhanced ( the millenium falcon's approach to the cloud city being the most obvious ) . in general , however , the changes to empire are less obvious than those to star wars , which were subtle enough in their own right . there's nothing in the special edition that changes the scope , quality , or intent of the film . it's a little bigger , a little brighter , and a little louder . the movie does not pick up where star wars left off . in terms of the mythological antecedents that lucas based much of his star wars trilogy on , there was nothing startling about vader's origins , but , considering the darkness it would inevitably inject into the series , it was a bold stroke . the scenes that begin with the luke/vader lightsaber duel and end with the young hero's despairing decision to allow himself to plummet out of vader's reach represent the most compelling sequence offered by any of the three movies . the structure of the empire strikes back is more complex than the relatively linear path traversed by star wars . instead of keeping the heroes together , as was the case in the first film , lucas , along with director irvin kershner and screenwriters leigh brackett and lawrence kasdan , elects to split them up . everything comes together at the end , and there's a reunion of sorts , but the empire strikes back concludes with so many unanswered questions that it's tantamount to a cliffhanger . all of the primary actors are more relaxed here than in star wars . harrison ford , easily the most successful of the three leads outside of star wars , shows obvious improvement , honing his cynical-but-lovable performance to a fine edge . the visual effects in the empire strikes back are far more impressive than those of star wars . from the approach of the imposing imperial walkers to the escape from the cloud city , there's a lot here to delight the eye . likewise , john williams' score , which uses multiple cues from star wars , displays the richness and maturity necessary for a darker , more operatic motion picture . because of the high quality of the original product , it doesn't show a hint of dating . neither the first nor the third chapters ( or , properly , the \" fourth \" and \" sixth \" ) of the star wars saga were able to match the narrative scope of empire , which today remains one of the finest and most rousing science fiction tales ever committed to the screen .",

            "message": "france/italy , 1967 u . s . re-release date : spring 1997 ( limited ) running length : 1 : 45 mpaa classification : not rated ( violence , mature themes ) theatrical aspect ratio : 1 . 66 : 1 cast : alain delon , francois perier , nathalie delon , cathy rosier , jacques leroy director : jean-pierre melville producers : raymond borderie , eugene lepicier screenplay : jean-pierre melville based on the novel the ronin by joan mcleod cinematography : henri decae music : francois de roubaix u . s . distributor : artificial eye in french with subtitles there can be many reasons for re-releasing a motion picture . in some cases , like star wars , the motive is as much for profit as it is for artistic reasons . the same claim cannot be made of le samourai , a 1967 thriller that has been cited by no less an authority than internationally-acclaimed director john woo as a nearly perfect movie . le samourai will not rake in money at the box office during this , its thirtieth anniversary re-release , but it will give a small legion of north american movie-goers an opportunity to see this landmark film uncut and in its full glory . woo is right -- le samourai is close to perfection . it combines stylish direction , an intelligent script , first-rate performances , and overpowering atmosphere into one of the most tense and absorbing thrillers ever to reach the screen . in trying to identify a film with a similar impact , i'm left grasping at thin air -- nothing quite like it exists in the annals of motion picture history , even when considering the work of alfred hitchcock . however , watching le samourai makes it obvious that directors like quentin tarantino and brian depalma are familiar with this particular entry on jean-pierre melville's resume . le samourai is developed like a chess game between two equally- intelligent , determined opponents . as the movie progresses and an apparent checkmate draws closer , the level of tension in le samourai reaches an almost-unbearable level . the film then proceeds to illustrate how this truth applies to the protagonist . alain delon's performance is subtle and mesmerizing . delon has an undeniable screen presence -- when the camera focuses on him , we cannot help but look . the first thing that strikes the viewer about le samourai is likely to be the aspect of the film that leaves the most lasting impression : its incredible sense of style . this is a black-and-white noir film photographed in color , with gloomy exteriors and dim interiors . it's always raining or cloudy , and the most prominent color is gray . visually , le samourai is arresting , but the movie's stylistic preeminence doesn't stop there . melville draws us into the cold , cruel world of his protagonist by presenting lengthy stretches in which there is no dialogue . the film opens with ten minutes of speech-free scenes , followed by a short verbal interchange , then two more minutes without dialogue , another brief conversation , three additional minutes without talking , and so forth . . . melville does not clutter up his film with needless chatter , and , as a result , when someone speaks in le samourai , we listen . delon is supported by a fine cast . francois perier plays the superintendent as a canny policeman who will do whatever it takes to get his man -- he can be charming or nasty , as circumstances demand . and cathie rosier portrays valerie as the perfect mix of the enigmatic and the alluring . if you're a fan of film noir in particular or thrillers in general , you owe it to yourself to seek out a copy of le samourai ( it should be released on video after its limited theatrical run ) . despite its absence on many critics \" best of \" lists , this motion picture deserves a place at the pinnacle of the genre . as john woo indicated , it's difficult to imagine a much more accomplished film .",

            "message": "contact is likely to change a lot of perceptions -- not only about the role of humankind in the universe , but about what special effects can do for a movie when they're used in the service of a story , rather than the other way around . contact is that rare big-budget motion picture that places ideas , characters , and plot above everything else . the film takes the richness of astronomer carl sagan's bestselling 1985 novel and re-invents it for the screen , retaining all the power and fascination of the book while adding a visual aspect that will not disappoint devoted fans . contact is as close as recent hollywood productions have come to a perfect example of cinema . all the elements are not only in place , but effectively realized . this is the kind of motion picture that restores one's faith in what can be produced when a large budget is used wisely . the participation of a superlative cast and crew doesn't always guarantee success , but , in this case , the high expectations have been met . the film is directed and co-produced by robert zemeckis , whose last effort was 1994's box office smash , forrest gump . as an on-again/off-again amateur astronomer , one of the first things i noticed about the film was its technical accuracy . this is undoubtedly the result of sagan's influence . all the details are correct ( at least as far as i was able to determine ) ; there are none of the movie cop-outs that film makers occasionally resort to in order to lower the intelligence level of the script . contact is believable in part because it doesn't replace true science with vague terms and gobbledygook . in his novel , sagan was careful to make everything , even the most farfetched parts , theoretically feasible . although the movie changes and condenses significant aspects of the original material , it remains true to this vision . contact opens with an unforgettable sequence that takes the viewer on a tour of the universe . it starts out in a familiar corner of space , with earth filling the screen . it's an amazing trip that only takes several minutes , but presages the wonders that contact's final half-hour holds for the viewer . although contact is rightfully being billed as the story of humanity's first encounter with an extraterrestrial life form , at its heart , it's really more about ellie and her quest for meaning in life . in her own words : \" for as long as i can remember , i've been searching for some reason why we're here -- what we're doing here , who are we ? \" ellie's trajectory places her on a collision course with answers to those questions , and it's the development of her character , and the resolution of this particular aspect of the story , that makes for a satisfying conclusion . in the end , the science fiction elements become subordinate to the personal ones . in its own unique way , contact offers a little bit of almost everything : drama , romance , suspense , and science fiction . it touches the emotions and the intellect . there are glorious special effects , wonderful acting , and a couple of impressive pyrotechnic displays . the plot contains the most believable approach to this subject matter ever presented in a movie . as he did in forrest gump , robert zemeckis makes excellent use of special effects . the standout sequences are those that take place in deep space and give us an awe-inspiring perception of how incredibly vast the universe is . but digital trickery , both subtle and obvious , is used on other occasions , as well . by carefully editing clips of clinton speeches and using a little creative dubbing , zemeckis makes it seem like the president is directly addressing the specific situations that arise during the course of contact . the cast is strong . tom skerritt and james woods take what could have been one-dimensional characters and develop them into something more . we don't exactly sympathize with them , but we understand their viewpoints . but the star of the film is jodie foster , who brings all of her considerable ability to the part of ellie , and infuses the character with passion , intelligence , and courage . foster deserves another oscar nomination for her work here . instead , in different ways , this movie recalls some of the best science fiction films . in fact , contact can stand on the same level as these and many other classics , and that is one definition of a great movie . if contact falls short in any area , it's an inability to fully develop all of its many subplots , but , given the time limitations of the medium ( the running length is already 2 : 30 ) , that's understandable . this is one of 1997's finest motion pictures , and is a forceful reminder that hollywood is still capable of making magic . \" as far as the filmmaking process is concerned , stars are essentially worthless - and absolutely essential . \" -- william goldman",

            "message": "move over , silence of the lambs ! with its rare mixture of intelligent plotting , flawless acting , and start-to-finish tension , copycat is a force to be reckoned with--hopefully both at the box office and when oscars are given out next spring . it amazes me that an entry from this genre , which is normally known for pointless gore and contrived storylines ( see--or rather don't see--don't talk to strangers ) , has turned out a motion picture this keen and complex . it's a difficult task to perfect this sort of story . there are so many areas where the script can fail that it's astounding how seamlessly copycat overcomes all obstacles . there are no stupid characters , contrived resolutions , or deus ex machinas . and the movie doesn't play games with the villain's identity--we aren't left wondering whether he's one of the supposed \" good guys . \" like seven , copycat isn't concerned with whodunnit , but why they did it and how they will strike next . in contrast to the brad pitt/morgan freeman movie , however , this picture has a rock-solid storyline with no gaping holes in logic . i've never been a big fan of sigourney weaver , but what she accomplishes here is impressive . i can't help wonder how much better death and the maiden would have been had she turned in a similar caliber performance there . from the opening scene in copycat , weaver has a good sense of dr . hudson , and she holds onto the character through all the emotional ups and downs . this is doubtlessly the actresses' best work to date . strong-willed , tough , and extremely competent , her mj monahan is the kind of smart , multi-layered role actors relish , and hunter is on target with her portrayal . this is a contained , dynamic performance without a hint of overacting . in many ways , what the actress does here exceeds what she managed in jane campion's new zealand period drama . the supporting cast is solid . dermot mulroney projects a likable cockiness as monahan's partner . the worst thing that can happen in a movie like this is for the characters to be a step behind the audience . that's not the case in copycat , where the viewer is in synch with what's occurring on-screen . tension and atmosphere are excellent , and director jon amiel pays careful attention to detail . parts of this film are frightening , and will have many viewers either on the edge of their seat or hiding their eyes . and , unlike in many so-called thrillers , the ending is not a let- down . comparisons with silence of the lambs are inevitable , but this movie is no mere copycat of jonathan demme's 1991 feature--it's a well-crafted improvement .",

( the script by de palma and lost world's david koepp sets the action during a hurricane in an attempt to pump up the adrenaline level and the noise . spouting cliched and ridiculous dialog , he screams such lines as , \" i was made for the sewer , baby ! \" actually the line is more apropos for the movie as a whole . but most people in the film are not who they seem to be , and the thin script makes all of them easy to guess . the plot , which is told in endless flashbacks , concerns the assassination of the secretary through a scheme set up by some malevolent businessmen ? that adjective is , of course , redundant in hollywood thrillers . although a brian de palma film requires a certain amount of gratuitous violence , this one is remarkably tame for the man who became famous when he made carrie . the movie's outline has some promise , but the movie itself is leaden . the film takes itself all too seriously . at best , it is a 1940s-style b movie . a little humor would have helped the script some , but a complete rewrite would have been better . and , although i hate to say it , a different director would have been the biggest improvement . it is rated r for violence and would be acceptable for teenagers .",

            "message": "so where do you go if you're an ex-doctor with a critically wounded patient to treat ? in his ubiquitous voice-over , he gets the best lines in mark haskell smith's script . his one-liners are sometimes funny and other times wise . ( \" life is all a matter of perspective , \" and \" hell does not always look like hell . on a good day , it can look a lot like l . a . \" ) the promising trailers for the film contain most of the good lines . playing god is the goriest film i've seen this year and the most gratuitously violent . when the tedious story starts dragging , as it does frequently , director andy wilson has someone stick something in a vein so blood can splatter the set . wilson's direction is aimless and confusing . when they are not throwing fits , his actors speak in whispers , which , admittedly , in this film is not necessarily a bad thing . eugene asks . at first , the script makes him seem the good bad guy as opposed to his estonian associates playing the bad bad guys , who attempt a world record for the most uses of the f-word in a single minute . the movie delights in attempts to shock the audience through blood and language . \" tonight , i said to myself , 'i will not get high , ' \" eugene tells the audience . \" i might just as well have said to myself , 'tonight , i will not breathe . ' \" and when the obligatory sequence comes where eugene goes cold turkey to give up his habit , he makes it look no worse than a case of the flu . a few chocolate bars are all it takes . plot holes and improbabilities abound . if any of the characters were likable , the frequent required leaps of faith might begin to get on your nerves , but with this collection of lowlifes , one has trouble caring . only david duchovny gives this film any humanity and provides any respite from its oppressive storyline . it is rated r for gore , excessive violence , hard drug usage , profanity , etc . the film is not appropriate for teenagers .",

            "message": "the problem with the movie , by director alain berliner ( my life in pink ) , is that neither of moore's lives -- as marie in the bucolic south of france or as marty in a spacious manhattan apartment -- are the least bit real on the screen . with warm light constantly bathing moore's face , the movie appears more like the pages of a glamour magazine than a motion picture . dressed always to the nines and living in picture postcard homes , moore appears to be a model on one long fashion shoot . with plot holes aplenty , the biggest might be why marty doesn't just catch a plane to marie's place , or vice versa , so that she can finally put an end to the charade . the pretentious script is full of such mumbo-jumbo . and what moore wishes to do is to pose rather than act . the director appears to have relinquished control to moore since his awkward staging makes sense only if one assumes that the film's purpose is nothing other than to be a vanity piece for moore . the only reason to stay to the end and the only thing to keep the viewers awake is pure curiosity about how the story will be resolved . the conclusion is kind of plausible , somewhat predictable and reasonably satisfying , but it certainly doesn't atone for making the audience endure the rest of this silly , lackluster film . it is rated pg-13 for scenes of sexuality and would be acceptable for kids 12 and up .",

( foster reportedly passed on the part because she didn't think the high blood level of the screenplay was worth her time . action director ridley scott ( g . i . jane ) replaces the more thoughtful jonathan demme , who besides the silence of the lambs is also known for such pictures as philadelphia . you might expect scott to be more dramatic , which he is in sections . more often , however , hannibal is paced so ploddingly that viewers will spend more time bored than grossed out . they will rarely be engrossed by the movie , which is quite tedious . the basic plot this time has dr . hannibal lecter abroad in florence . of course , without him the sequel probably would have never been made . too bad he didn't hold out for more money . those going in for blood and gore will not be disappointed , even if they do have to endure long , dull periods between slicing and dicing . intestines fly , and worse , much worse . this god angle turns out to be a cinematic dead end . besides many logical problems , the dialog lacks almost any comedic punch . about the only memorable line is that hannibal likes to \" eat the rude . \" \" i'm not happy ! \" and neither will most viewers be , based on the disgusted comments i heard going out of my packed screening . if you've barely been able to stomach most of the movie , leave before the last act , which becomes a bigger barfola than a ride on an upside-down roller coaster after a greasy hamburger . hannibal runs a very long 2 : 11 . it is rated r for strong gruesome violence , some nudity and language and would be acceptable for high school seniors and older .",

( as the characters die in the movie , see if you notice an interesting relationship with the order of their death and the actor's probable salary . ) finally , there are the real stars of the show -- the snakes . the special effects are the only reason to see the film . the fake snakes' movements are fascinating . director luis llosa uses typical horror film techniques to shock and gross out the audience . we get to hear people's bones snap , and we get an inside view from the snake's stomach as someone is swallowed alive . the snake even gets to regurgitate one of its human kills . perhaps because the filmmakers realized how hopeless anaconda was , they pumped up the music and the background sounds so much that you will leave the theater looking for a little peace and quiet . one thing that can be said for the film , it does have a high energy level and lots of action , even if it is all preposterous . it is rated pg-13 for gross and sometimes gory violence . i'd be careful about letting kids under 13 go unless they are used to schlock horror films . i give the movie thumbs down and * 1/2 for the special effects . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

( bond films titillate with hints of nudity and sex while showing neither . the line pokes fun at the switch but also serves to remind us that our old favorite is gone . ( connery will be back two more times as james bond , something we didn't know or even suspect when this movie first played . ) she's so much smarter than lazenby than she seems out of place . even without make-up or fancy clothes her natural beauty dominated the room like a thick perfume . ) when lazenby , as bond , quits in a huff early on in the film , one feels like applauding in the vain hope that connery will return forthwith -- the applause being motivated as much by wanting to dispose of lazenby and his lackluster performance as by getting our old hero back . the story's plot reeks of triviality . spectre's #1 , played this time without much energy by telly savalas rather than the much better donald pleasence , runs an exclusive allergy institute high atop a private , snow-covered mountain . richard maibaum's script doesn't tell us much about spectre's plans until the last third of the movie . that is , unless spectre gets a huge payoff . we're still waiting , however , for thunderball-style personal jetpacks to be available at sharper image . the show has several technical problems . \" i hope i can live up to your high standards , \" bond says at one point . well , lazenby couldn't and didn't . it is rated pg for violence and sexual innuendo and would be fine for kids around nine and up . my son jeffrey , almost 9 , liked this movie but still likes thunderball the best . he did not like lazenby at all , and he thought the new actor playing spectre's #1 was not creepy enough . he has seen the first 6 bond films now , and he likes this one least of all .",

            "message": "\" i have absolutely no idea what i'm going to do with the rest of my life , \" she confesses sadly over a lonely dinner with her husband . although this may sound serious , the out-of-towners , a remake of the 1970 neil simon screenplay , is a comedy , albeit not a particularly funny one . the kellermans are played without much chemistry by steve martin and goldie hawn , who deliver decidedly subpar performances . needless to say , their love life isn't . this is followed by a cliff's notes version of planes , trains & automobiles that lands them broke and luggageless in new york . as directed by sam weisman and written by marc lawrence , the movie is full of missteps and bad judgement . too often in a hurry , few of the jokes are set up properly . gwen , for example , plows into the fulton fish market with her car in the type of scene that you've seen a hundred times before , but it's edited so fast that you're never sure what is supposed to be funny about it . and when a starving george heads for the vending machine , you are so sure that it will jam that , when it does , the result is laugh free . the story does have a few genuinely humorous moments . steve martin does get to strut his stuff in an energetic sequence set in central park . did i mention john cleese's performance as the obsequious hotel manager , who is a secret cross-dresser ? he seems to have dropped in from another movie , which isn't much better than this one . if you've seen the trailers to the out-of-towners , you've already seen most of the best parts of the story . the rest is just lame padding . it is rated pg-13 for sexuality and drug references and would be fine for kids around 12 and up .",

( \" everything's got a moral , if only you can find it . \" -- lewis carroll . \" always make the audience suffer as much as possible . \" -- alfred hitchcock . ) at other times , the characters will leap from their normal , mindless banter into a pseudo-intellectualism in hopes of obtaining the heretofore missing laughs . two stories are developed to advance the minimal slice-of-life plot . most of the show is as exciting as white bread . although there is a gross scene of a man , listed as \" vomit man \" in the credits , throwing up in a sink while michael brushes his teeth , the film strives hard never to offend or take any risks . the upbeat and lyrical songs reminded me of those from the graduate . i rarely notice the songs , and when i do , it probably means i am getting bored , which i was . the print we saw had major problems . the colors looked liked washed out sepia , and the backgrounds were overexposed . some of the soundtrack had a problem too . whether this is endemic to all of the prints , i have no idea . the choppy editing by ken sallows reminded me of a print that had been spliced together too often and small parts were now missing . the net result was that it felt like a 60s film that was being rereleased without any restoration . as a film critic , i see just about every film that gets a us distributor and some that never do . i , for one , am growing tired of seeing college students where everyone drinks and smokes dope . surely there are some who abstain from these substances . never in a college age film , do i see anyone who says a simple , \" no thanks , i don't do that stuff . \" i am not looking for a big statement , just a recognition that not everyone thinks its cool to get drunk and stoned . love and other catastrophes runs an amazingly short 1 : 16 , but i bet you will think it feels longer . it would be fine for older teenagers . flaws and all , the film does a least have an upbeat spirit . still , it never engaged me enough to be able to recommend it . i give a generous * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

( wim wenders is also listed on the writing credits since he did the screenplay for the original movie . ) the audience at our screening was squirming in their seats since the movie seemed as though it was going on for an eternity . as good as some of the visuals are , they are highly repetitive and done excruciatingly slowly . \" some things are true whether you believe in them or not , \" he explains with his usual gravity . the chemistry between them lacks the emotional punch that the story requires . nathan has a secret that drives the second half of the film . franz steals most of his scenes with an energy sadly lacking in the rest of the movie . the monotonic and glacially paced story eventually comes to its completely predictable and highly manipulative ending . the city of angels could easily be remade as a short film with music but no words . now that's a remake worth seeing . it is rated pg-13 for sexuality and brief male nudity and would be fine for kids around ten and up .",

( small but irritating production mistakes mar its presentation . one of the key nighttime scenes , for example , is lit as bright as day . ) predictable but honest , it just doesn't pack the emotional wallop of the original . still , for a pleasant family film with likeable characters and a moral message around every corner , shiloh 2 fills the bill . it is rated pg for mild thematic elements and would be fine for all ages . my son jeffrey , age 10 , called it \" such a sweet little movie \" and gave it * * * 1/2 . normally quiet during a movie , he kept speaking up during this one to say how good it was .",

( \" matters of great concern should be treated lightly . the problem with the passages is that many are obtuse , and frequently their relationship to the action is relatively minimal . the film works best when it goes for dead-pan comedy . \" what are you gonna do ? \" this fatalistic humor resonates with the audience , but it doesn't occur nearly often enough . the visuals of the \" made men \" , who've never met a cannoli they didn't like , trying to run up stairs are funny , as are the scenes of these would-be sumo wrestlers bonding with each other with lots of bear hugs . is there a market for self-consciously stylish movies about gangsters if the films operate in what seems like slow-motion ? jarmusch's die hard fans will certainly want to see ghost dog . it is rated r for strong violence and language and would be acceptable for older teenagers .",

            "message": "let's cut to the chase and answer the second most important question in every moviegoer's mind . but , the phantom menace is a visually audacious triumph whose look far surpasses the first three . a thoroughly entertaining motion picture , it is a pg-rated treat for the entire family . this brings me to the most asked question , how do you snag some early tickets to the most widely anticipated film since gone with the wind ? to this cinematic conundrum , this review will offer no guidance . written and directed by george lucas , the movie works best when it's at its busiest . as armies of computer-generated figures war with each other , the movie infuses the audience with a visceral excitement that's palpable . your adrenaline will pump as if you personally are taking on those cleverly designed robotic soldiers of the future . if the look and the impressive sound are the picture's high points , the charisma-challenged characters are its low points . the uninspired casting features some well-known actors who seem oddly out of place and some new actors who don't . there isn't a han solo class character to be found anywhere on this mission . harrison ford , with his macho swagger and his humorous energy and charm , is sadly missed . no one with his abilities is found anywhere in this cast . if some are to the manor born , ford's natural home is in a space opera series like star wars or an old-fashioned adventure anthology like indiana jones . giving restrained and wooden performances , these fine actors look like they feel awkward and somehow slightly embarrassed in their roles . i expected them to warm up to their characters , but they never did . both act way below their potential . with all looks and no menace , darth maul's no darth vader , not even close . he's more like a video game opponent who's waiting to be sliced and diced . this reminded me of the scene from spinal tap , in which they claim that their band is the best because the volume on their amplifier goes to 11 rather 10 like the other bands' amplifiers do . much has already been written about the latter , with people divided between those who find jake lloyd's performance endearing and those who think it's lifeless . with his confident charm he is the one of the best reasons to get excited about the future episodes . the movie's most exhilarating scene comes in a big pod racing extravaganza that's lifted straight out of ben hur . the technological tour de force crowd scenes alone are worth the price of admission . a two-headed race announcer supplies the humor in a picture that is sadly bereft of much comedy . the lovable r2-d2 ( kenny baker ) and c-3po ( anthony daniels ) are back , but they aren't allocated anywhere near the screen time that they deserve -- a waste of one of moviedom's best comedy duos . the dialog has classic star wars lingo . ( \" be wary , i feel a disturbance in the force , \" is one of the many canonical lines . ) the retreads are fun , but what is missing are many memorable new lines . john williams's wonderfully dramatic music draws heavily on his previous work for the series yet still manages to be fresh . gavin bocquet's lavish sets are visually enthralling with the queen's large italian renaissance palace with its massive marble columns being among the handsomest . but the thin and sometimes confusing plot is all just a backdrop for the action . the middle section of the movie gets bogged down with the machinations of senate bureaucrats squabbling over issues ranging from taxes to trade to leadership . sometimes , you may feel like screaming at the screen , \" all right already , let's get back to the action . \" if we want to hear about bickering politicians , we can read the newspaper . so is the phantom menace a disappointment ? a little . the first three movies were such a huge success and built such a loyal following of fans ; the hype that ensued was to be expected . with such enormous hype comes an inevitable disappointment . but is the movie one that you wouldn't want to miss ? absolutely . see it on the largest screen you can find and with the best sound possible . this is a big event . don't miss it . and don't even consider waiting until it comes out on video . star wars episode i - the phantom menace runs 2 : 11 . it is rated pg for some sci-fi violence and would be fine for all ages . my son jeffrey , age 10 , thought it was almost better than the first 3 and gave it * * * * . he went on and on about the things he liked , including the music , the relationships , the figures and the action . he couldn't think of anything in the movie he didn't like .",

( okay , i know it's only spring , but this film , with it's realistic battle sequences , is a big budget , summer thriller even if it arrives in port a bit early . ) this simple plan goes seriously awry , setting up a wonderful , classic war sequence that takes place mainly underwater in a sub as it is being attacked . the tension is palpable , causing your adrenaline to pump like crazy . as captain dahlgren , bill paxton gives the movie's only wooden performance , arguably because of his stilted dialog . his xo is played by the film's star , matthew mcconaughey , who turns in one of his most convincing pieces of acting , eschewing his tendency to superciliousness ( amistad , for example ) . if there is one part of the movie that best captures the film's essence , it is the realistically frightening depth charge scenes . an imaginative captain can help , but basically you have to wait and pray that they will miss you . one of the few unabashedly patriotic movies in some time , u-571 pays homage to our brave soldiers who fought and died in a world at war . and it lets you vicariously feel some of their trauma as they wonder if each moment will be their last . it is rated pg-13 for war violence and would be fine for kids around 12 and up .",

            "message": "this swedish movie was nominated for an academy award for best foreign film in 2000 , but lost to all about my mother . for my money , under the sun is easily the better of the two . told with impeccable honesty , the script by johanna hald , david neal and colin nutley , based on the h . e . in a compelling , straightforward performance , rolf lassg ? rd plays olof , the large , beefy farmer . although some might see him as ruggedly handsome , most would call him homelessly plain . actually , the farm may be primitive , but it looks quite inviting . with jens fischer's golden-tinted cinematography and paddy moloney's soothing music , the norwegian tourist board should set up a booth in the theater lobby . bookings for norwegian tours should be brisk afterwards . under the sun goes for naturalness where other movies might try for bits of sensationalism to ignite the viewers used to hollywood dramatics . erik is only willing to say the dreaded \" i love you \" if it quickly gets something in return . the one mystery that keeps nagging at the viewers and at erik is what an attractive 33-year-old woman like ellen would find in olof . the answer to this question isn't quite the shocker that many might expect , but it sets up a touching and satisfying ending to a delightful little tale . the film is in swedish with english subtitles . it is not rated but might be r for sexual situations and would be acceptable for teenagers . just send me a letter with the word \" subscribe \" in the subject line .",

            "message": "it was produced and directed by wolfgang petersen of das boot and in the line of fire fame . this is a director who knows how to create great tension that really grabs the audience's attention and holds it through out the entire movie . he is also a master at action sequences and the military helicopter scenes in this flick were evidence of his abilities as well as that of the cinematographer . it works so fast that if you are not dead in twenty-four hours after being exposed , you are safe . this germ detective story is excellent and the pacing is good so that your eyes stay glued to the screen . go to the bathroom before entering , you don't want to miss any of the details . it is complex and yet quite easy to follow . outbreak at its best was almost as good . petersen is a master director . after seeing this movie , i should warn you that you may never want to fly in airplanes again . you certainly will find yourself leaving any theater where someone coughs . sad to say , we also learn from the beginning that there is a subplot in the show that is going to have us believe that our military has some covert operations of massively evil proportions going on . without this ridiculous and unnecessary sojourn into again lambasting our own generals , the movie had a perfectly plausible ring to it . the acting was uneven . dustin hoffman , whom i have not seen in many movies recently , stars as the military chief of biological research . hoffman delivers star quality work . also excellent in the show was hoffman's sidekick played by cuba gooding jr . he played the aggressive green recruit character in fresh and interesting ways . rene russo who was so excellent in petersen's last show , in the line of fire , was given a poorly written part as hoffman's domestic counterpart--the head of germ research at the cdc . russo's acting was not credible and moreover , i would just as soon have seen her whole part eliminated . the germ research had the energy to stand on its own and did not need a romantic second subplot to add excitement to the movie . another tragedy of the film was the wasting of morgan freeman as hoffman's commanding general . this was the weakest character freeman has ever been asked to play--very one dimensional . this brilliant actor ( glory , driving miss daisy , the shawshank redemption , etc . ) did not seem to care about the show and gave a pedestrian performance . finally , the less said about donald sutherland's part as the major general who was freeman's boss , the better . both characters were cliches that should not have been in a movie of this caliber . outbreak runs an exciting 2 : 00 . it is rated r for bleeding eyeballs and other makeup effects that you see on halloween masks . there was a 10 year old behind me that loved the movie . i recommend this tension filled detective story to everyone above the age of about 9 , and i award it * * * . absent the unnecessary diabolical military subplot , i would have been able to give the movie another half star . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : march 11 , 1995 opinions expressed are solely mine & not meant to reflect my employer's .",

            "message": "as i reported recently , hollywood is on a shakespeare tear . the studios just released three shakespearean films and have more about to be unveiled . this week i got to see for the first time the laurence olivier classic richard iii from 1956 . this is one of three shakespearean films where olivier was both director and star . in hamlet he actually won the award as well as garnered a nomination for best director . when i saw the film , the theater was rather full . since the sign on the door incorrectly said looking for richard , perhaps there were even a few people there wondering when al pacino would show up on screen . the audience's reaction was fascinating . the teenagers saw the costumes and the exaggerated acting style and laughed frequently at the film . to them the movie was a parody . otto heller's old saturated technicolor print and roger k . furse's disneyland style sets combined to look like the wizard of oz . actually , it visually reminded me of the 5 , 000 fingers of dr . moreover , olivier's elaborate costumes , bad hairdo , and fake nose kept me thinking how much olivier looked liked hans conried playing dr . terwilliker . most of the rest of the audience seemed to have my reaction , an interesting film , but not quite what i had expected . it certainly does not possess the seriousness of his henry v . the film opens with a hokey score by william walton . like most of the film , although it seems so dated today , it probably seemed fresh and stirring in its time . the sets have a fairy tale quality , and the whole movie , with the exception of the ending , has the claustrophobic feeling of a filmed play . today's shakespearean interpreters , especially branagh and zeffirelli , open up the plays much more when they bring them to the screen . in olivier's days , most of the movies were filmed in the controlled environments of the studios' sound stages . another difference is in the way shakespeare's text is adapted . most modern screenwriters , most especially baz luhrmann with his screenplay this year for romeo and juliet , truncate long monologues . alan dent and laurence olivier's script for this richard iii edit only slightly the long monologues and have them delivered in sparsely furnished rooms so that the viewer has few distractions . here i must be honest , as much as i admired olivier's richard iii , i found mckellen's more involving . olivier's film is interesting and certainly the acting is excellent , but i had trouble getting over how dated it all seemed . don't get me wrong , i do like old movies and think olivier's henry v is brilliant . it is at this point that the movie really came alive for me . one never knows of course what the original prints looked like . olivier's richard iii is less serious and more colorful than i had expected , but it is a film well worth seeing . i do not feel i can close without listing some of the many members of the cast . richard iii ran 2 : 19 in the version i saw , but some footage has been lost over the years . originally it ran about 2 : 40 . the film is not rated but would get a g today . there is no sex , nudity , or bad language . the little violence is cartoonish , but there is a little blood . the film would be fine for a child of any age , but young children can only appreciate the visuals since the language is way too obscure for them . i recommend the film to you and give it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

            "message": "\" i meant to say a step-father . \" it gets worse . the kid is adorable but only speaks russian , and louka only speaks czech . thus is the setup for the sweet and touching little picture kolya by director jan sverak . kolya is this year's entry from the czech republic to the academy for consideration for best foreign film . kolya is a sometimes slow picture that quickly wins your heart . there is great chemistry in the acting of the two leads . he is a serious looking but playful man whom women in the story find charming , and so does everyone in the audience . the film's sexual situations are never explicit , and yet the show has some naturally erotic scenes . the best has to do with louka's bow while playing at a funeral . besides taking one of the lead roles , zdenek sverak , the father of the director , also created the imaginative script . in the story louka earns his income as a musician playing at funerals -- lots of funerals . zdenek sverak's performance is strong enough to carry the film , but he is usually upstaged by the other lead , andrej chalimon as the little boy with whom he does not quite know what to do . chalimon is one of the sweetest and most photogenic child actors i have seen in a long time . his facial expressions are so sincere and sad that they will steal your heart . most of the time he is that way , but in some precious little scenes , like the time he is read to in russian over the phone , he comes alive and chatters away . although it will come as no surprise that the script has louka coming to love his unwanted son , it is significantly more believable and involving than the hollywood-style versions we have come to expect . when the inevitable child-in-danger part comes , you will be as frightened as i was and yet never feel manipulated . the show ends on both a sad and a happy note . i was starting to cry at the former until i almost started to clap at the latter . kolya is a show that will make you richer in spirit for having seen it . it is rated pg-13 for sexual situations and for a couple of mild profanities . to be interested kids should probably be about ten or so . i recommend the film to you and award it * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture .",

            "message": "as i have told my readers before , the best documentaries take you to worlds you would never go to on your own . stand tall is a fascinating feature length documentary about the sport of bodybuilding . if you're thinking , that it's already been done and that the film was 1977's pumping iron starring arnold schwarzenegger , you'd be right . this film , which i saw at san jose's cinequest film festival , takes a different approach . even if the thought of seeing a bunch of greased up men flexing their biceps is not your idea of a good spectator sport , you will be hard pressed not to like this captivating film . it is much more than a sports film . he told me that nalley was willing to give up on having schwarzenegger in it if need be , but booth knew how important it was to have a big name in the film . once he actually spoke with arnold himself , arnold was gracious and excited about appearing even though his salary consisted of nothing more than a box of his favorite , albeit expensive , cigars . this is a documentary that was well planned in advance and carefully edited . the result is a story with a strong narrative drive and an enlightening script . you can see this scrawny kid with a hearing aid who seems the least likely person in the world to become a world class bodybuilder . booth said after the movie was over that the bodybuilders in the picture grew up in an age when none of them ever used steroids , so lou's feat is all the more impressive . i have to admit the scenes of the rippling flesh all shiny from the bodybuilder's oil , did make me want to laugh sometimes . and yet , who among us , especially we males , has not looked in the mirror and tried flexing his muscles . ourselves . bodybuilding is rather like that . certainly there is the adoration of the fans , but it is a solitary sport requiring enormous dedication to one's own body . as i sat in the audience , i began reflecting on competitive body sizes . bodybuilders force themselves to exercise so that their arms are about the same size as the waists of models who starve themselves to get their waists that small . there is a certain symmetry to the two endeavors if you think about it . the men in the picture , who are just slightly younger than i , have to be admired for their dedication . i am proud of having written 253 movie reviews last year , but my hard work pales in significance to the dedication of these men . good documentaries are full of little tidbits that you would never guess . you might not be surprised to learn that bodybuilders push their bodies so hard that they injure themselves frequently . what you might not guess is that these guys are hard to x-ray . the x-ray technicians have to boost the settings an indeterminate amount since these guys are so thick -- not with easy to see through fat , but with relatively opaque muscles . so what was wrong with the documentary ? not much . its only failing is that of many low budget documentaries , whose makers do not fully appreciate the importance of lighting . some of the scenes are just too dark . faster film or more lighting equipment would have helped enormously . what is not clear is if the film will end up being shown to mass markets or tailored more to sports fans . i told him i thought the film would appeal to a wide audience so i hoped he found a distributor who would distribute it thus . let me end on my favorite piece of trivia from the film . stand tall runs a well paced 1 : 24 . it is not rated , but would get a g rating . there is nothing to offend anyone of any age . the show would be fine for any kid interested in it . i am sure lou would have loved to have seen a film like this when he was young . i recommend this fascinating movie to you and give it * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : february 2 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

            "message": "one fun activity for parents during the holidays is to suggest an old film and see if they can interest their kids . although black-and-white films are frequently viewed as suspect , ones in color are greeted with more of an open mind . and if you can find a colorful action film , even if it is from six decades ago , then there is a real possibility of a take home hit . nominated for the 1938 academy award for best picture and winner of three oscars for erich wolfgang korngold's melodramatic music , ralph dawson's fast paced editing and carl jules weyl's lush sets , the film is probably best remembered for errol flynn's charismatic acting as sir robin of locksley , a . k . a . robin hood . let me cut to the chase and say that the tape was indeed popular in the rhodes household . the littlest rhodes , jeffrey , age 8 , liked it so much that he viewed it at least three times and maybe more . i'll let him discuss his fascination with the picture in his usual section at the end of the review . simply stated , the film derives its success from being one of the best of its genre , the swashbuckler . robin , with a smile from ear-to-ear , fights off a hundred men without a scratch . although the picture can be considered as little more than a 1930's james bond , the production values and the acting raise it above that level . robin hood is a classic story of rich and poor . robin steals from the rich and gives to the poor as every schoolchild knows . robin , with his courage and athletic skills , serves as a role model for kids . and with the lovely olivia de havilland playing the dreamy-eyed lady marian fitzswalter , the story has heavy romantic overtones . filmed in the typical , richly oversaturated colors produced by early technicolor , the flesh tones are overly pink and there few color subtleties , which match perfectly the wonderfully exaggerated acting of the players . in scene after scene the picture charms the audience . who wouldn't fall for robin as he shows up incognito to win the archery contest , even if the outcome is so clearly preordained . watching the picture today does provide some jarring moments . sherlock holmes as the villain , sir guy of gisbourne , for example , just doesn't seem right , even if basil rathbone did have a real-life identity outside of his most famous role . and then there are those wigs from the makeup department -- so bad , they look like rejects from a mel brooks comedy . as was popular in the cinema of that era , people die with the most gentle prick of the sword and without any nasty , bloody holes to spoil the wardrobe or the looks . bad guys are banished rather than killed , and lovers go off hand-in-hand , doing nothing more explicitly sexual than kissing . the result is a wonderful fairy tale of a movie with delightful , cartoonish figures . hollywood rarely makes such high quality family films like this anymore , so try to savor the old ones when you can . it is not rated , but containing absolutely nothing offensive , it would get a g rating and is fine for all ages . jeffrey thinks the film is \" great \" and gives it * * * * . he recommends the movie particularly for people who do not likely bloody pictures -- he hates the sight of blood in movies .",

            "message": "in writer/director jeremy podeswa's mesmerizing the five senses , rona ( mary-louise parker from grand canyon ) has a small problem -- an impaired sense of taste . a baker who creates marvelous-looking but incredibly-bland cakes , rona hasn't a clue as to how to create flavor . this is one of many overlapping stories in the five senses . using this plot gimmick , podeswa , an extremely gifted writer and director , never lets the limitations of the setup confine the bounds of his storytelling . the beauty of the story is that no matter how much we learn about each character , we are compelled to discover even more . most writers introduce a dozen main characters only to the detriment of narrative clarity , but podeswa manages to create complex characterization within the bounds of minimal screen time . his movie calls to mind lawrence kasdan's grand canyon in the depth of its characterization . the five senses in tone most reminds one of another canadian film , the sweet hereafter , but the five senses mixes comedy and romance with its tragedies . the deliberate and successful slow pacing works in both pictures , whereas slowness is usually cinematic death for a film . robert is a funny , friendly guy , who is light-years away from the clich ? s we are normally presented with as gay people . his search has the same bittersweet tone as the rest of the movie , but his character works so hard to be happy that we could vote him \" most wanting to succeed . \" we root for him all the way even when it seems that no one appreciates him as they should . the hauntingly beautiful music by composers alexina louie and alex pauk perfectly captures and enhances the mood of the film . full of strings , wind instruments and dreamy voices , the score is striking in its emotional impact on the film and lovely on its own . eventually , the stories wrap up quite satisfactorily but without any unnatural convergences or actions . podeswa doesn't insult your intelligence by providing some cheap epilogue . it is rated r for sexuality and language and would be acceptable for teenagers .",

            "message": "for someone who is a strict traditionalist when it comes to shakespeare , and to opera too for that matter , i was amazed at how much i was enthralled by ian mckellen's vision of richard iii as a world war ii british fascist . this is a well acted production where the images are even more impressive than the acting . usually when critics say the images are the best part of a movie , they are reviewing a mediocre show where the visuals are its redeeming feature . here they enhance an already outstanding production . as an aside , the theater where i saw the film had an overscan problem and the opening title clearly proclaimed the movie to be richard ii so i thought for a second i was going to see a prequel . after hating director oliver parker's recent and dreary rendition of othello , it was refreshing to see director richard loncraine breath such tremendous life-force into richard iii . no since the even better kenneth branagh's henry v and franco zeffirelli's romeo and juliet , have i enjoyed shakespeare so much . the film is based on shakespeare's play , but i believe many of the lines were either rearranged or abbreviated . i read that ian mckellen spent several years trying to sell various hollywood studios on the making of this film , but when the studios read the script , they kept saying that they hoped he made it , but they were not going to be the ones to fiance anything that bizarre . whether there is a big enough audience for a film like this to turn a profit is another question of course . in this speech and most others in the movie , it is pronounced and given nuances fresh and not found in most actors' shakespearean repertoire . the speech actually continues as nature calls , and richard leaves to use the urinal . in most movies i find contrivances like soliloquies in the bathroom to be silly at best , but mckellen's strength of acting manages to pull it off effectively . this is a fascinating and true story that averages a murder every five minutes , and thanks to great editing by paul green , the movie flies along . as richard says , \" plots have i laid . \" as the words moved fast and furiously , i realized why shakespeare is so unapproachable to a mass audience , it requires attention . unlike the sound bites of political campaigns or mtv , all thoughts are not delivered in short sentences full of monosyllabic words designed to let the brain stay on autopilot . i will not insult your intelligence by attempting a condensed version of the story here . instead i will concentrate on reviewing the film itself . the cast is full of good actors and actresses who are coached by the director to give some of their very best performances even though their roles may be quite minor . robert downey jr . , for example , plays rivers and has less than a dozen lines , but delivers them to great effect . adrian dunbar plays tyrell as a chilling man who has almost as few scruples as richard . jim broadbent has a larger ( pun intended ) role as buckingham , playing him as the herman goering of the picture . richard smiles deviously and replies with a sweet voice , \" you have a daughter . \" he quickly retorts in a melodious voice , \" yes , if the devil tempt you to do good . \" a chilling performance , but a bit hard to watch . now who else have i forgotten in this ensemble cast ? there is not a bad acting job in the movie . the best acting , and one worth many awards , is that of ian mckellen . in case you are curious , the \" a horse , a horse , my kingdom for a horse \" speech is delivered in a broken down jeep . the best part of the entire movie are the sets by tony burrough . the wide variety of costumes ( shuna harwood ) range from army uniforms reminiscent of the nazis to lush clothing for teas full of cream colors for the men and primary colors for the women . the cinematography ( peter biziou ) of hazy and shiny blues and greens with strong flesh tones adds a feeling of death and conniving around every corner . the last scene with the loud al jolson music is , well , a hoot . it is rated r for tastefully done violence , a little sex , very brief nudity , and one hard drug usage scene . i am sorry to say that it has massive smoking for no purpose . this show would be fine for teenagers , and i would strongly encourage them and anyone with an attention span longer than 15 seconds to see this film . it speaks to our time and every time . i gladly give the movie * * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

            "message": "director jean-luc godard's contempt ( le mepris ) has been hailed by some critics as one of the best films ever made . the dialog remains more romantic than sexual although with brigitte bardot playing the part of the wife , camille javal , the audiences at the time of the picture's release may have had trouble concentrating on the lines spoken . ( the modicum of female rear nudity may have been a bit shocking at the time , but the movie is quite tame by today's standards . ) godard's film wants to challenge your mind and not titillate your senses , hence the few nude scenes are there more for realism than exploitation . brigitte bardot gives an incredible performance as the 28-year-old typist who does not have a clue about what she wants in life . the film works precisely because she convinces us of her disdain for most aspects of her life , especially her marriage . what could he have said or done that made her feel thus ? when odyssey's director fritz lang , played by the great director himself , starts talking about how cultured the performance will be , jerry will have none of it . \" every time i hear the word culture , i bring out my checkbook , \" he declares as he writes a check on the spot to paul to rewrite the script . lacking the smooth refinements of the rest of the characters , jerry , played by jack palance , is crude but believes himself more refined than any of them . \" gods , i like gods , \" he says about his movie . \" i know exactly how they feel . \" godard has a great sense for the visual , and his films are feasts for the eyes . in contempt several scenes are memorable . and then , who could forget the opening scene of her lying on the sheets with her toes twirling in the air . my personal favorite aspect of the production is the music by georges delerue . it has a timelessness and a sweeping grandeur that starts off romantic but becomes increasingly morose as the tragedy unfolds . the film is about many things . certainly godard's love of the cinema comes across in ways explicit and subtle . the film , which is more a dramatic tone poem than a traditional movie , ultimately is about the impact of the death of love . effusive jerry couldn't care less about any of this . contempt is an entrancing and moving film that leaves its audiences thinking and somewhat devastated . one may forget many of the story's details , but its impact will remain . contempt runs 1 : 45 but feels much shorter perhaps because the story takes place in less than 24 hours . the film is partially in french with english subtitles and partially in english . it is not rated but would be a mild r for some female rear nudity , a little profanity , and a little violence . the film would be fine for teenagers . i strongly recommend you see or rent this marvelous film , and i give it * * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : august 16 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",

            "message": "titantic , writer and director james cameron's much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200 , 000 , 000 epic , arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises , whether the film is worth it ? as a business proposition , it seems hard to see how it can ever break even , but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful . if you've already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure , think again . the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world's most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers . in either case , it is filmmaking at its best . when we entered the press screening , my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long . he said no but that the time would go by so fast she'd never notice the length . amazingly , he was right . titanic is one of the few long films that doesn't suffer because of it . although almost all of the movie happens in flashback , one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk . using a computer simulation , the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later , which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing . in a classic movie theme , the two parts of the ship , first class and steerage ( third-class ) exist in sharp contrast . the strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing . never tawdry and rarely explicit , their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story . leonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma . when he confronts cal , for example , he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal's supercilious put-downs . kate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose . the chemistry between these two academy award nominees , him for what's eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility , is nothing short of astonishing . if the film breaks after an hour and a half , which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up , you will still get one of the best films of the year . peter lamont's sets are more than authentic . it then shifts to the ship's massive gears and then to the bright-hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals . easily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest . at first , since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull , not some big gaping hole , the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else . what a lark . we've struck an iceberg . their civility borders on insanity , but it is touching nevertheless . the story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface . there are more than enough characters to love and to hate , and all of the casting is dead-on . special effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable . people are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately . besides being romantic and dramatic , the script includes liberal doses of humor . from the many deliciously subtle verbal put-downs to the physical comedy , as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man , the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears . basically there was a design decision to have fewer than half of the necessary life boats -- it made the decks look too crowded otherwise . perhaps the sinking is best summarized by one of the guggenheim's on-board the ship . \" no thanks , \" the elegantly attired guggenheim replies . \" we're dressed in our best and would prefer to go down like gentlemen . but we would like a brandy . \" it is rated pg-13 for tastefully and delicately presented sex and nudity and would be fine for kids twelve and up .",

            "message": "so what kind of a man was harry lime ? director carol reed's classic the third man has just been restored and is in the process of being re-released theatrically . now , with the restoration of the 11 minutes of footage trimmed from the american release by producer david o . selznick , we can see the film as continental audiences first saw it . not having seen the movie in what seems like a zillion years , but which must be less than 50 since the film originally came out in 1949 , i was able to look at it again with few preconceived notions . set in a post-world-war-ii vienna , the picture does a masterful job of recreating an era of complex politics and a city picking itself up from the ashes . in the story by graham greene and alexander korda , the ambiguous characters perfectly match robert krasker's heavily shadowed black-and-white cinematography . the characters' exact intentions and motivations are up for discussion . seeing the movie again after all these years , i was struck by several things . although harry lime is the central character , wells has a remarkably small part . his first appearance in the movie has a power and a charm that makes it one of the most endearing scenes in cinematic history . with its dominant austrian zither music , the film serves notice that it doesn't intend to fit neatly into any genre . the music is whimsical , mysterious and sometimes even a little sad . every time you start to ponder a situation seriously , the music comes up to suggest that things may not be quite what they seem . and it warns us not to take things too seriously . the writers seem to be just off camera , laughing with little in-jokes that they alone understand . the scene in the ferris wheel , in which harry draws a heart on the glass , is one such moment . how is it to be taken ? the writers seem to enjoy toying with us . the overwhelming emotion on seeing it again is to realize how the picture works best on a visual and a musical level . one could imagine doing away with all of the dialog and relying on the pictures and the music alone . actually , the only truly memorable line is harry's reflection to holly . space operas aside , one wonders which films of today will still be popular 50 years from now . this simple question is harder than it might appear since it involves not only artistic merit but also changing opinions . while waiting for the mid-twenty-first century's official classics list , go enjoy some of the sure winners now , like the third man , especially if you're lucky enough to have it playing theatrically in your area . it is rated pg for mature themes and would be fine for any kid old enough to be interested , which probably means around 12 and up .",

            "message": "in a time of bloated productions where special effects have become the movies' real stars , going back to a classic like director sidney lumet's 12 angry men can remind viewers what movie making is supposed to be about -- acting . the script by reginald rose is firmly rooted in the 1950s , but , like a shakespearean play , most of the lines reveal deeper meanings and hidden truths . arguably one of the best early television dramas was the original 1954 \" studio one \" version of 12 angry men . the only link between the two is reginald rose's script which was kept almost totally intact . the cast and the director changed , but the story stayed the same . and what a story . ( the showtime cable network recently remade the story , and , being smart enough to use basically the same script , managed to make an interesting film , albeit not in the same league as the original two . ) the rich drama with minimalist sets occurs almost completely within the confines of a jury room . the incredibly strong ensemble cast for the jury includes : henry fonda , lee j . cobb , ed begley , e . g . when he comes to the part about a reasonable doubt , he repeats it with such an emphasis that he seems to be suggesting that any doubt they may have in their minds about the defendant's guilt is probably not reasonable . the accused , played with big , soulful eyes by john savoca , never speaks , but his sunken , despondent demeanor says it all . if you didn't know better , you could assume they were reviewing some movie they had seen . none of them seems to be concerned in the least that the defendant's life is at stake . this voice of reason comes from a juror played by henry fonda , giving a resolute and perfect performance that should have at least gotten him an academy award nomination for best actor , but didn't . sidney lumet was nominated for best director but lost to david lean for the bridge on the river kwai . and the best picture award was lost the same way . easily the biggest shame was that reginald rose's script -- an absolute classic -- lost to the excellent but lesser one for the bridge on the river kwai . \" you can't refute facts . \" his banker's glasses , one of the film's few props , turn out to be key to the case's solution . although most jurors are known by the intensity of their convictions , robert webber plays someone who works in advertising and views serving on a jury no more seriously that he would concocting a laundry soap jingle . he will abstain from the second ballot , and if they all vote guilty , so will he . the beauty of rose's script is that we come to know each of the jurors by the end of the deliberations . most writers would gloss over some of them to concentrate on a few , but rose gives each a unique personality and background . boris kaufman's intimate , black-and-white cinematography makes each member of the audience feel like a 13th juror . and the wailing , solo flute music by kenyon hopkins provides a somber atmosphere without ever overpowering . my only complaint with lumet's direction is that the last holdout for guilty is allowed to convert all too abruptly . it is not rated but would be pg for mature themes . the show would be fine for any child old enough to be interested in such a serious story . i give the film my top recommendation and rating of * * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",
